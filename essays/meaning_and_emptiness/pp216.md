# Adam and Ijad, or Why Ibn Arabi is not a Neoplatonist

In  the  first  pages  of  his  book  on  the  history  of  Western  Sufism,3  Mark   Sedgwick argues that it is the shared episteme of Neoplatonism that made  it  possible  for  European  spiritual  seekers  to  find  something  akin  to  their   own  world-views  in  the  texts  of  Muslim  mystics.  The  discursive  markers   that designate a text as Neoplatonic are, according to him, the following:

* the  relation  between  the  ultimate  One  and  the  many  is  that  of  an   ontological emanation: “everything must derive from the One without  implicating the One in any form of change.”4

* the individual soul found in matter and the universal soul found in in- telligence are one: “by parallel a landscape which a number of people  are  admiring  remains  one,  even  though  each  person  has  their  own   separate and different view of that landscape.”5

* Neoplatonism implies a chain of being in which being is homogeneous  to consciousness. This is to say that the consciousness—or as Sedgwick  calls  it  the  “life  force”6—of  being  is  being  itself  and  not  something   other than being itself. 

On the basis of these three discursive markers, Sedgwick then argues that  Ibn ‘Arabī is a Neoplatonist because he sees God as both “One and Intel- ligence”;7  in  modern  terms,  we  would  say  as  simultaneously  being  and   consciousness.8

I  would  add  to  these  three  items  a  fourth,  namely  a  presence  of  the   metaphor of the mirror that Plotinus uses to describe the relation between  matter  and  intelligence.  Material  bodies  are  similar  to  mirrors  in  which   images of being appear and disappear. Plotinus writes: 

> The being which is imagined in it is “not” being but only a fleeting frivolity;  accordingly, the things which seem to come to be in it are frivolities, nothing  but phantoms on a phantom, just like something in a mirror which really exists  in one place but is reflected in another.9 

The  purpose  of  the  metaphor  of  the  mirror  in  a  similar  context  is  then  to   acknowledge the difference between different existent things while remain- ing  mindful  of  the  fact  that  “we  cannot  think  of  something  of  God  here   and something else there, nor of all God gathered at some one spot: there  is  an  instantaneous  presence  everywhere,  nothing  containing  and  nothing
