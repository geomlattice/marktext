emptiness  and  irreality  of  all  the  objects  my  desire  meets  and  uplifts  the   troubadour to the status of one that not only knows the emptiness of the Big  Other that is nothing else than a social construction, but also to the status of  one that conveys the paradox of desire that is only moved by the emptiness  of its desired object. The Thing is the irrepresentable that makes it possible  to re-present the Real that moves my language, but is never described by  it.63 Or, as Ibn ‘Arabī puts it, desire in its most intense form is always desire  for something that is ‘adam.64

Moreover,  we  are  now  able  to  appreciate  in  a  new  way  the  use  that  the   Islamic  tradition  makes  of  the  Name-of-the-Father.  It  is  a  name  that   is  cut  and  thus  disrupts  any  attempt  to  build  a  symmetry  between  the   whole-that-is  and  the  whole-that-is  known—that  is,  to  tie  again  the  knot   Being&Consciousness.  This  difference  between  the  whole-that-is  and  the   whole-that-is-known  is  best  exemplified  by  two  apparently  contradictory   statements: Ibn ‘Arabī’s remark that Muhammad is “father of the spirits”65  and the Qur’anic verse (33:40): “[And know, O believers, that] Muhammad  is not the father of any one of your men, but is God’s Apostle and the Seal  of all Prophets. And God has indeed full knowledge of everything.”

y confronting these two statements and reading the classical and early  modern  commentators  of  the  Qur’an,  we  understand  that  what  is  here  at   stake  is  that  while  every  existing  essence  of  a  human  individual  is  ex  ante  the expression of a meaning that finds in Muhammad its cosmic and princi- pal source, nevertheless, ex post, on the day of Judgement every biological  father will flee from his child and thus not be accountable for the sins of his  child.66 This is the reason why God has stripped from Muhammad the pos- sibility of being a “father.” Muhammad will not abandon his community but  instead  intercede  for  them,  and,  through  the  mercy  that  is  given  to  Mus- lims, he will also intercede for the whole of humanity on the Day of Judge- ment. In other words, Muhammad mirrors God through three features:

*  His being an orphan67 reminds us of the Qur’anic verse about God: He  “begets not and neither is He begotten” (112:3)

* In the same way that Islam strictly rejects that the term “Father” may  apply to God, it reminds its believers that Muhammad should not be  called father.
