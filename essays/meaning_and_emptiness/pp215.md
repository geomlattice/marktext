The great Muslim teacher Ibn ‘Arabī (1165–1240) has been introduced in  the  West  first  through  Renaissance  epistemologies  and  later,  in  the  twen- tieth  century,  through  late  occultist  epistemologies.  Neoplatonism,  Her- meticism,  Christian  Kabbalah,  and  Martinist  Free-Masonry  were  mingled   to  create  a  hermeneutical  device  through  which  the  modern  scholar  or   convert  to  Islam  could  approach  Ibn  ‘Arabī  ‘s  texts.  Nowadays,  however,   historians  of  Sufism  tend  to  read  Ibn  ‘Arabī  only  through  a  Neoplatonist   framework,1  while  specialists  of  Ibn  ‘Arabī  generally  defend  the  idea  that   his teachings cannot be reduced to a Neoplatonist paradigm.2 The first part  of this chapter shall argue that Ibn ‘Arabī is not a Neoplatonist. This is then  followed  by  a  digression  into  Lacanian  theory  that  takes  Lacan’s  attempt   to  extract  himself  from  the  kind  of  thinking  of  a  “Christian  Kabbalist”  (1962) as well as from late occultism (1975–1976) seriously. The digression  through Lacanian theory enables me then to use his transformation of the  French language in such a way that we are no longer in need of the couple  on which European modernity has constructed its imperial apprehension of  other spiritualities: the knot “Being&Consciousness.”
