and René Guénon) which Lacan had closely known in his youth.46 Modern  occultism47 designates a set of spiritual discourses and practices that histori- cally have begun with the French magician Eliphas Levy (1810–1875) and  ended with the New Age movement in the 1970s. It organises an eclectic  set of spiritual teachings in a self-explaining philosophical order that histori- cally comes from Martinist Free-Masonry, popular spinizosim and a reac- tualisation  of  late  neo-alexandrian  philosophy.48  This  philosophical  order   is  considered  then  to  be  a  “scientific”  and  “pure  doctrine”49  of  the  total   identity between being as such and consciousness: “the total and absolute  knowledge . . . is . . . the realisation of the totality of being.”50 

“Science”  and  “Pure  doctrine”  are  the  reasons  why  the  translations  of   modern occult teachings into social interactions have most often taken the  form of cults,51 as there must be an embodied “Guru” that not only repeat- edly  declares  authoritatively  the  identity  between  these  two  terms,  but   also  expels  from  his  sight  anything  that  exceeds,  lacks,  disturbs  the  belief   in  their  identity.  Furthermore,  according  to  the  same  logic,  the  modern   occultist  tries  to  enter  the  totality  of  all  that  is  in  an  immediate  way  by   investing  in,  with  a  strong  desire  and  expectation,  the  word  “initiation.”52  In  a  modern  context,  “initiation”  would  then  bring  the  spiritual  seeker   directly  into  the  utmost  mystery  of  all  that  is.  The  seeker  is  thus  moved   by the idea that there is someone in the world that has a stable possession  of  the  whole-of-knowledge.  This  “Guru”  is  entirely  untouched  by  human   passions  and  must  be  an  embodiment  of  a  pure  intellectual  doctrine.  By   meeting this person, the modern spiritual seeker believes that he can gain  a  direct  access  to  the  whole-of-being  that  is  entirely  known  by  the  one   that  embodies  the  spiritual  master.  As  Guénon  himself  puts  it:  “We  have   already stated before that initiation must have a non-human origin . . . this  is also the case for the rites and symbols it uses.”53 In this sense, a spiritual  quest  informed  by  Guénon’s  doctrine  is  the  quest  for  an  enjoyment,  as   the  pupil  invests  his  desire  in  the  body  of  the  master  who  embodies  the   subject  who  is  supposed-to-know  the  whole-of-knowledge.  The  body  of   the spiritual master acts, in a Lacanian language, as the objet petit a54 that  is  a  mediator  between  the  whole-of-knowledge,  the  whole-of-being  and   the modern spiritual seeker.55 The “Guru” carries then for the disciple the   Name-of-the-Father that stabilises the awareness the pupil has of his own  body  (that  is  seen  through  the  eyes  of  his  “Guru”)  while  he  sutures  the   whole-of-being with the whole-that-is-known.

It is after having started to investigate the differences between a Chris- tian Kabbalist way of thinking and a Jewish way that Lacan acknowledged,  on  19  December  1962:  “Someone  called  me  the  last  of  the  Christian
