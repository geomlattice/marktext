Syrian church by the end of the eighth century. 58 Timothy, nevertheless, clearly presupposed that the fullest resources for study of Aristotle were still not to be found in the Abbasid capital, but in the West Syrian monasteries, as we know from his efforts to fi nd further material in the libraries of Mār Mattai and Mār Zina. He himself had been educated at the East Syrian monastery of Bashosh, where he may have fi rst encountered Aristotle. 59 He was trilingual, although he considered Syriac to be his own language, and while clearly preferring to read the texts in this language, he could compare a Syriac text with the Greek when occasion required, as he did with a passage in Athanasius’ version of the Posterior Analytics . In asking his correspondent Pethion to look at Mār Mattai for ‘some commentary or  scholia by anyone, whether Syriac or not, to . . . the Topics , Sophistical Refuta- tions , Rhetoric and Poetics ’, he was evidently happy to receive them in Greek or  Syriac, and at Mār Zina he asked his correspondent to look for ‘the two treatises on poets (i.e. Aristotle’s Poetics ), for I have one’. As already noted, he knew of the  commentaries of Olympiodorus, Stephanus, Sergius, and Alexander (of Aphrodi- sias), and of versions of Dionysius by Athanasius and Phocas. As is well known,  he himself was a translator, or at least the ‘overseer’ of Abū Nūḥ’s translation, of the Topics from Syriac to Arabic, by commission of the caliph al-Mahdī.

Around a century after Timothy we encounter in Baghdad the East Syrian whose rigorous focus on Aristotle (unlike the more diverse interests of Ḥunayn  and al-Kindī) and whose establishment of a group or school of Aristotelian philos- ophy gave rise to al-Fārābī’s imaginary peregrination of the school of philosophy  from Alexandria to Baghdad. Abū Bišr Mattā (died 940) was ignorant of Greek,  but was an active translator of Aristotle and Aristotelian commentators from Syr- iac to Arabic, as were his pupil Yaḥyā ibn ‘Adī and Yaḥyā’s pupil Ibn Zur‘a, both  West Syrians, more of whose works have survived than those of Mattā. 61 Among the extant works of the latter two, we have evidence of interest in the writings of Dionysius (see the following).

We can therefore trace over a period of around fi ve hundred years (Sergius died in 536, Ibn Zur‘a in 1008) a series of Graeco-Syriac followed by Syro-Arabic  translators and commentators of Aristotle who were also closely interested in Dio- nysius. (Among the following only for Theophilus and Mattā do we currently  lack such evidence relating to Dionysius.) Excluding the anonymous translators and others who cannot be associated directly with Alexandria, Qenneshre, or Baghdad, as translators from Greek to Syriac of Aristotle or Aristotelian writings, we can adduce, prior to Ḥunayn and his school, Sergius (pseudo-Aristotelian De mundo and Alexander’s On the Principles of the Universe ), Athanasius (died 687,  Prior Analytics to Sophistical Refutations ), Jacob of Edessa (died 708, Catego- ries ), George, bishop of the Arabs (died 724, Categories to Prior Analytics ), and  Theophilus of Edessa, the astrologer to al-Mahdī (died 785, Prior Analytics and  Sophistical Refutations ). Both Sergius and Athanasius made translations of Dio- nysius, while commentaries on Aristotle were written by Sergius ( Categories )  and George ( Categories to Prior Analytics ), an epitome of Aristotle’s logic by Athanasius, and an Encheiridion with passages taken (directly or indirectly) from
