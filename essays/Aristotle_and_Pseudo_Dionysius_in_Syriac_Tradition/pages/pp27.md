or propaedeutic to Plato, in his enthusiasm for Dionysius evident in his translation of the corpus we have reason to suppose that he remained nevertheless to some extent true to those Alexandrian teachers in seeing Aristotle as inferior to a ‘more divine’ pedagogue. That pedagogue, however, was not Plato as interpreted by Proclus, but the Holy Scriptures as interpreted by Dionysius.

The Neoplatonic curriculum of Plato reading which followed that of Aristotle  proceeded in parallel with that posited for Aristotle, the theoretical dialogues pro- ceeding from the logical (those dealing with words and concepts) to the physical  and then the theological. 14 If we now endeavour to understand how Sergius might have related his reading of Aristotle to the ‘higher’ cycle not of Plato, but of his Christian Bible as interpreted by Pseudo-Dionysius, the key text at our disposal is his Memra on the Spiritual Life . Here he asserts that ‘the science of theoria is  divided according to the ranks of the things over which it spreads’, and he enu- merates seven parts:

1. subsists by means of demonstrations and combinations of worded statements;
2. is made known in the hidden silence of the intellect without word;
3. extends over the visible natures;
4. ascends to the hidden substancies higher than vision;
5. relates to the faculties adjoining the visible natures;
6. resides in the things which afterwards enter from outside into rational natures through their freedom;
7. which is like its fi nest fl ower, by means of all those (already) mentioned touches, as far as is permitted, on the exalted radiance of the hidden divinity. 15

Subsequently Sergius relates that the men ‘expert’ in (3) call it ‘natural’ (science), and (5) is called ‘mathematics’, (4) ‘spiritual theoria or divine science’, (6) ‘second natural science’, and (7) ‘divine theoria ’. The last of these is termed ‘the hidden and veiled vision of the intellect which reaches out, as much as is possible, through  some distant similarity between (the two of) them, towards the unfathomable radi- ance of Being’ 16 and later on identifi ed in ‘the Lord’s teaching’ as the ‘Kingdom of  God’, 17 while (4) is identifi ed with the scriptural ‘Kingdom of Heaven’. 18 Different sorts of theoria correspond to the difference of the objects, ascending upwards to the fi rst form, ‘which is not a knowledge but an excess of ignorance and superior to knowledge’. 19 Elsewhere Sergius presents us with a threefold division of the contemplative life, ascending from ‘knowledge of sensible and visible natures’ or ‘natural knowledge’, through ‘ theoria of rational and invisible natures’ or ‘spiritual theoria ’, to ‘ theoria of that which is beyond nature’ or ‘divine contemplation’. 20

We appear therefore to have two parallel, three- or four-part ascending curric- ula, one philosophical and the other monastic and theological. 21 Each has its own  organon : in (1) we can recognise Aristotle’s logic, in (2) its theological counter- part, probably (although not exclusively) of Evagrian inspiration. 22 In (3), (4),  and (5) we recognise (Aristotelian) physics, metaphysics, and mathematics, 23 in (6) and (4) Evagrius’ ‘second natural science’ and ‘spiritual theoria or divine
