Aristotle’s Metaphysics by Jacob of Edessa. As translators in Baghdad of Aris- totle and his commentators from Syriac to Arabic we can name prior to Ḥunayn  Timothy (died 823, Topics ), and subsequent to Ḥunayn Mattā (died 940, Posterior  Analytics , Sophistical Refutations , Poetics , De caelo , De gen. et corr ., Meteo- rologica , Metaphysics Λ, commentaries by Alexander, Themistius, and Olympi- odorus), Yaḥyā ibn ‘Adī (died 975, Categories , Topics , Sophistical Refutations ,  Poetics , Physics , De anima ?, Metaphysics Λ and Μ, commentaries by Alexander, Themistius, and Olympiodorus), and Ibn Zur‘a ( Sophistical Refutations , Book of Animals ). Timothy, Yaḥyā, and Ibn Zur‘a were all familiar with Dionysius, and as already noted Timothy knew of commentaries on Aristotle. Commentaries on Aristotle were written by Mattā ( Categories to Topics , Physics , Metaphysics α), Yaḥyā ( Categories to Sophistical Refutations , Physics , De caelo ?, Metaphysics α), and Ibn Zur‘a (various). 62

## The school of Matta

The earliest known Syriac translations of treatises of Aristotle other than those of the logic are those stemming from the school of Ḥunayn. Ḥunayn’s translations covered a wider range than those from the school of Mattā, particularly because they included his numerous medical translations. Insight into the curriculum of Mattā’s school can be gained from the Fihrist of Ibn al-Nadīm, but also to some degree from The Philosophy of Aristotle of al-Fārābī, the school’s most illustrious pupil. The fi rst twelve treatises of Aristotle listed in the Fihrist appear in the same  sequence in al-Fārābī’s work: these are the eight treatises of the Organon ( Cate- gories to Poetics ) and the four principal physical treatises ( Physics , De caelo , De  gen. et corr ., and Meteorologica ), 63 thus the eight instrumental and four principal physical treatises of the Alexandrian autoprosōpa .  64 Mattā is said to have written commentaries on the fi rst fi ve of these and on the Physics , and to have made translations of commentaries on the last three. 65 Of the remaining three of these, Quwairā, with whom he studied, is said to have written a commentary on the  Sophistical Refutations , Mattā’s follower al-Fārābī, as is well known, wrote sev- eral (partially extant) works on the Rhetoric , and Mattā himself translated the  Poetics . 66 The only other treatise to be mentioned in connection with Mattā, apart from a cryptic reference in the section On Sense ,  67 is the ultimate book in the Fihrist ’s and al-Fārābī’s lists, 68 the Metaphysics , of which Mattā translated Book Λ with the commentaries of Alexander and Themistius 69 and, as we know from elsewhere, wrote a commentary on Book α.  70 From this information the conclu- sion can reasonably be drawn that Mattā’s curriculum of Aristotle reading was  that of the Alexandrians: the eight organika , the four principal physica , and the one theological treatise, the Metaphysics . 71

In the Philosophy of Aristotle , however, al-Fārābī lists, between the Meteoro- logica and the Metaphysics , many of the biological treatises (including the De  anima ), several of which also appear (in slightly different form and sequence) as numbers thirteen to fi fteen in the Fihrist .  72 If we now look at the treatises which
