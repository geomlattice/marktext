There's a widely popular podcast known as the History of Philosophy or The History of Philosophy without Gaps. This series has an Indian Philosophy version where Samkhya is discussed. In the citations for the Episode that first exposed me, there is citation to a work by Gerald James Larson known as Classical Samkhya. 

While scanning Wikipedia to learn more about Hatha Yoga, I saw reference to an encyclopedia that Larson worked on. I found that this was part of a series of encyclopedia and that there was another work on Samkhya.

My reserach with Samkhya begins with Larson, who is critical of Mircea Eliade's engagement with Samkhya in Classical Samkhya. Larson claims that Eliade reduces Samkhya to the Yoga of the Sutras all too quickly. 

Different circumstances led me to Trika Shaivism, but research there led me to discover that Samkhya is a philosophical progenitor of the Shaivism that Abhinvagupta is a part of. Lacan mentions him in the Ecrit, and the Lucana is a work of semiotics, surely. Samkhya goes on to impact Vedanta and Buddhism. Whether for or against it, Samkhya was a central topic and foundation of discussion for some time in Indian Philosophy.
