At the same time, of course, it is clear enough that the Samkhya system did not emerge fully grown, like Athena from the head of Zeus, even though the Samkhya texts make precisely such claims for the founder of the system, Kapila.8 Samkhya philosophy was hardly the product of a single mind in ancient times, pace Garbe, nor was it a blurred set of intuitions that finally got its house in order through the genius of Vijnanabhiksu, pace Dasgupta. The history of the tradition has already been surveyed in the last chapter and need not be repeated here, but it may be useful to summarize briefly the diachronic, locations for the synchronic system that is to be presented in the sequel, namely:

1. There was a coherent Samkhya conceptual system, often refer- red to as the sastitantra ("the system or science of sixty topics"),  that was widely known by the year 400 of the Common Era (that is to say, the interim period that is post-Isvarakrsna and pre-Dignaga). 

2. The conceptual system had been in existence for some centu- ries earlier and had been undergoing considerable modifica- tion through the work of Pancasikha, Varsaganya, Vindhya- vasin, and so on.

3. There were probably a variety of attempts in this early period  to summarize the basic contours of the system, but one sum- mary came to be accepted as a standard presentation, namely,  that summary as set forth in Isvarakrsna's Samkhyakarika.

4. This system, modified in some important respects (along the lines of Varsaganya's and Vindhyavasin's views) is the basis of Patanjali's TogasUtra and its commentaries. 

5. The commentaries on the Karika come considerably later, and apart from the Tuktidipika1 appear to lack a firsthand grasp of the system qua system, and even the Tuktidipika presupposes  the full content of the system instead of presenting that con- tent.

6. The Tattvasamasa and the SamkhyasUtra together with their commentaries, though undoubtedly preserving much old material, are nevertheless late texts (post-1000) that tend to interpret the old Samkhya system with a notable Vedanta bias.
