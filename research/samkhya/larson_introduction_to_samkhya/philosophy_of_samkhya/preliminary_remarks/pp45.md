ger have pursued among the pre-Socratic traditions of the Western philosophical tradition.

In any case, the task of discussing Samkhya as a philosophical system  involves a good deal more than historical research, philological investi- gation, and comparison and contrast with the agenda items of classical  Indian philosophy, though, of course, such conventional approaches  are a prerequisite for reaching the threshold of the system. Historical re- search provides some helpful bits and pieces of the puzzle, glimpses, and  hints of how the Samkhya methodology of enumeration slowly emerged into a conceptual system, even though the final system qua system is nowhere fully exposed in an extant text in other than a summary fashion. Philological work takes one a bit further, helping to determine the relevant set of technical terms and providing some sense of which lists and enumerations are more important than others. The Samkhya texts, however, are largely laconic lists, and the later commentators are remarkably unhelpful in explaining the relevance or meaning of  the various lists (and, in this sense, notably unlike the later commen- tators on the other systems of classical Indian philosophy). Further  progress can be made by examining the manner in which Samkhya is criticized in laterphilosophical traditions—for example, byDignaga, Jinendrabuddhi, Mallavadin, Simhasuri, Samkara, Ramanuja, and so forth — but as was mentioned earlier this later agenda of Indian  philosophy has moved considerably beyond the older Samkhya specu- lative environment. Moreover, there remains not a single Samkhya  rejoinder to these ripostes by Samkhya's opponents — with the possible exception of the Yuktidipika, which is clearly a Samkhya polemic vis-a-vis Buddhist and Naiyayika critiques of Samkhya. Samkhya's role in the history of classical Indian philosophy is comparable, mutatis  mutandis, to that of Garvaka materialism, that is to say, a sort of philo- sophical "whipping boy" abused by all but never allowed to respond —  or to shift metaphors, an intellectual "paper tiger" seldom taken seriously but providing a convenient point of departure for doing other things.

In discussing Samkhya philosophy, then, after one has pursued his- torical work as far as possible, after one has read all of the extant texts,  and after one has studied all of the criticisms of Samkhya in the larger classical philosophical literature, one has only attained what K. C. Bhattacharya has aptly called "... a hazy view of a grand system of speculative metaphysics." To sharpen the view, the interpreter must engage in " . . . supplying of missing links from one's imagination." This cannot mean, of course, inventing notions or projecting a favored perspective on the evidence that is unwarranted. The "supplying of missing links from one's imagination" means, rather, searching for relations, bundles of relations, and possible interpretive perspectives that may not be directly expressed in the texts but that bring together
