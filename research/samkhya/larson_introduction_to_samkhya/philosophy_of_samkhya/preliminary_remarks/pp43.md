# The Philosophy of Samkhya

## Preliminary Remarks

Although the main outlines of the history and literature of Samkhya are reasonably clear, the same cannot be said about the details of the system qua philosophical system. As was mentioned in the last chapter, there appears to have been a break in the Samkhya textual tradition  at an early date. Beginning with I svarakrsna's Samkhyakarika and there- after, there are only summaries and digests of the system, and many  of the commentators are almost as much at a loss to explain the full system as is a modern interpreter. This is unfortunate, for in many ways the evidence suggests that Samkhya philosophy stands at the fountainhead of systematic Indian reflection, somewhat on analogy with Pythagoreanism and other pre-Socratic systems in ancient Greece. As is well known, the influence of Samkhya is ubiquitous in South  Asian cultural life, not only in philosophy but in medicine, law, state- craft, mythology, cosmology, theology, and devotional literature.  Samkhya was evidently a direct descendent of older and unsystematic  Upanisadic speculation, a precursor of much of India's scientific lite- rature and an older sibling of the first philosophical efforts in South  Asia (including Jain, Buddhist, Vaisesika, Mimamsa, and Yoga tradi- tions ).

To be sure, certain characteristic philosophical notions are conti- nually attributed to Samkhya in the history of Indian philosophy—  for example, the dualism of consciousness and materiality (purusa and prakrti), the guna theory, the theory that the effect preexists in the cause in a potential state (satkaryavada), the plurality of puruxas, and so forth—  but there is a notable absence of the larger conceptual and specula- tive framework from which these characteristic Samkhya notions are  derived, and more than that, an absence of any firm sense that these so-called characteristic notions were, in fact, central within the Sam-
