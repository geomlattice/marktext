"thirteenfold instrument" or lifiga functions as a whole by "seizing" (aharana) (presumably through the motor capacities), "holding"  (dharand) (presumably through the sense capacities), and "illuminat- ing" (prakaia) (presumably through the "internal organ") (SK 32).15  The tenfold "external" divisions of the linga are referred to as the "doors" (dvara) of awareness, and the three divisions of the "internal organ" are referred to as the "door-keepers" (dvarins) (SK 35).

The set of 17. Items (4) through (20) represent the structure of  egoity (ahamkara), and it should be noted, therefore, that "self-aware- ness," according to Samkhya philosophy, is a complex phenomenon  encompassing mental states (mind, sense capacities, and motor func- tioning) and physical components (the subtle elements).16

The set of 18. Items (3) through (20), namely, intellect, egoity, mind, the five sense capacities, the five motor functions, and the five subtle elements, taken together are referred to as the "subtle body" (,lirigaiarira or sUksmaiarira), which is detachable from any particular gross body and is, therefore, capable of transmigration in a continuing  series of gross embodiments.17 Gross bodies (sthulasarira) are one- time-only aggregations of gross elements. In the case of human gross  bodies, these are genetically derived from mother and father (with hair, blood, and flesh from the maternal line, and bone, tendon, and marrow from the paternal line). Such human gross bodies are "womb  born" (jarayuja) and become enlivened when linked with a transmigrat- ing "subtle body." There are also "egg born" (antfaja), "seed born"  (udbhijja) and "moisture born" (svedaja) gross bodies for other sorts of sentient beings (and see Tuktidifiika, p. 120 on SK 39).

## (B) Enumerations relating to the fundamental predispositions (bhava).

The set of 8. Inherent to the intellect, in addition to its basic tattva nature of reflective discerning, is a set of 8 fundamental predispositions (bhava) or instinctual tendencies that guide the life-trajectory of a sentient being, namely:

1. the predisposition toward meritorious behavior (dharma)

2. the predisposition toward knowledge (jndna)

3. the predisposition toward nonattachment (vairagya)

4. the predisposition toward power (aiivarya)

5. the predisposition toward demeritorious behavior (adharma)

6. the predisposition toward ignorance (ajnana)

7. the predisposition toward attachment (avairagya)

8. the predisposition toward impotence (anaisvarya) (SK 23)

Whereas reflective discerning represents the material dimension of  buddhi, the fundamental predispositions represent the "efficient" possi- bilities of the buddhi. The fundamental predispositions, therefore, are
