# I. Samkhya as Enumeration

Because the term '  iSamkhya" means "enumeration" or "relating to  number," one reasonable point of departure for presenting the Sam- khya philosophical system as a "complete system of human communi- cation" is to outline the more prominent sets of enumerations.

(A) Enumerations relating to the basic principles (tattvas)

The set of 25. First and foremost, of course, is the set of 25 that
encompasses the basic principles of the system, namely:

1. pure consciousness (purusa)
2. primordial materiality (mulaprakrti)
3. intellect (buddhi or mahat)
4. egoity (ahamkara)
5. mind (manas)â€”both a sense capacity and an action capacity

6. hearing (Srotra) -----\
7. touching (tvac)  -------\
8. seeing (caksus)  --------->  the five sense capacities
9. tasting (rasana) -------/        (buddhindriyas)
10. smelling (ghrana)----/

11. speaking (vac) ----------\
12. grasping/prehending (pani)\
13. walking/motion (pada) -----> the five action capacities
14. excreting (payu) ---------/      (karmendriyas)
15. procreating (upastha)----/

16. sound (sabda)   -----\
17. contact (sparsa)---------\
18. form (rupa)     -----------> the five subtle elements
19. taste (rasa)    ---------/      (tanmatras)
20. smell (gandha)  -----/

21. "space"/ether (akasa)-\
22. wind/air (vayu) ----------\
23. fire (tejas)    -----------> the five gross elements
24. water (ap)      ----------/      (mahabhutas)
25. earth (prthivi) ------/

According to Samkhya philosophy, among these twenty-five princi- ples, only the first two are independent existents, namely, pure con- sciousness (purusa) and primordial materiality (mulaprakrti). Inother  words, only items (1) and (2) exist in some sense as "distinct" or "separate" from one another. The two are described in Samkhya philosophy as being ungenerated, outside of ordinary space and time, stable, simple, unsupported, nonmergent (or nondissolvable), without parts, and independent (SK IO).9 The relation between them is one  of simple copresence (SK 19). Pure consciousness is inherently inac- tive, but primordial materiality is inherently generative in the sense  that it is capable of generating a set of discrete or manifest subdivisions when activated by the catalytic presence of pure consciousness. Items  (3) through (25) make up the various subdivisions of primordial mate- riality and are, thus, internal to primordial materiality or represent
"parts" of a totally functioning "whole," which is primordial materia- lity. These twenty-three subdivisions are described as being generated,  temporal, spatial, unstable, composite, supported, mergent (or dissolv- able), made up of parts, and contingent (SK 10). Seven of the sub- divisions of primordial materiality, namely, intellect, egoity, and the  five subtle elements are described as being both generated, that is to say, emergents from primordial materiality, and generative, that is to say, capable of generating subsequent subdivisions. The remaining sixteen subdivisions, namely, the mind, the five sense capacities, the five action capacities, and the five gross elements are only generated, that is to say, incapable of generating additional subdivisions. Intellect is generated out of primordial materiality but also generates egoity. Egoity is generated out of intellect but also generates the mind, the five sense capacities, the five action capacities, and the five subtle elements. The five subtle elements are generated out of egoity but also generate the five gross elements. Subtle elements are so called because they are the generic (avisesa) material essences for all specific (visesa) elements. They are imperceptible to ordinary persons, whereas gross elements can be perceived by ordinary persons.

The subtle elements are the generic presuppositions for the experi- ence of all specific objectivity. Plve kinds of specific sensations may be  experienced, namely, specific vibrations via the ear (speaking, music, sounds, and so forth), specific contacts via the skin (hot, cold, and so forth), specific forms via the eyes (colors, shapes), specific tastes via the tongue (bitter, sweet), and specific smells via the nose. According to Samkhya, the apprehension of a specific vibration is only possible if  there is an undifferentiated generic receptivity for sound, or put differ- ently, if the experiencer is in some sense actually constituted by the  generic, material essence of sound, that is, actually made up of a subtle sound element. The subtle sound element itself is not any particular sound. It is the generic essence of sound, the presupposition for all  particular sounds, the universal possibility of sound-as-such. Simi- larly, the apprehension of a specific contact is only possible if there is  an undifferentiated generic receptivity for touch, the universal possi- bility of touch-as-such, namely, the subtle touch element, and so forth.  The subtle elements, therefore, are not functions or capacities (as are, for example, the five senses or the motor capacities of an organism) nor are they the actual sense organs (eye, ear, and so forth) which, of course, are aggregates of gross elements. They are, rather, subtle, material essences or presuppositions with which perceptual and motor  functioning correlate and through which certain aspects of the mate- rial world become differentiated. If such subtle, material essences or  presuppositions were not present, no specific objects could possibly be experienced or become manifest, and in this sense the subtle elements correlate with and may be said to "generate" the gross elements. In
the absence of subtle elements, in other words, there would only be an unmanifest mass of primordial materiality. Some have suggested that the subtle elements might be usefully compared to Platonic ideas or universals, but it must be kept in mind that for Samkhya all such ideas or universals have some sort of subtle, material basis (requiring, in other words, a reconceptualization of idealism in terms of reductive materialism, as will be discussed further in the sequel).10

Regarding the manner in which gross elements are derived from subtle elements, the important Samkhya texts differ, suggesting that the manner of derivation was an open issue even in the classical period. The Karika itself simply asserts that the five gross elements are derived from the five subtle elements (SK 22 and 28). Some commentaries {The Tattvakaumudi, Mdtharavrtli, Jayamangala, and so forth) argue for a so-called "accumulation theory" of derivation, according to which each successive subtle element combines with the preceding ones in  order to generate a gross element.11 The subtle sound element gene- rates the space/ether gross element (akasa); the subtle touch element  and the subtle sound element generate the gross air/wind element  (vayu); the subtle form element with the subtle sound and touch ele- ments generate the gross fire element (tejas); the subtle taste element  with subtle sound, touch, and form elements generate the gross water element (ap); and the subtle smell element with the subtle sound, touch, form, and taste elements generate the gross earth element (prthivi). According to the Tuktidipika (Pandeya edition, p. 91 and pp. 117-118, and hereafter all page references are to the Pandeya edition), this "accumulation theory" is attributed to Varsaganya. The commentary of Gaudapada argues, however, that each subtle element is capable of generating each gross element singly. The Chinese commentary on the Karika offers yet another interpretation.12 According to it, each subtle element generates not only a respective gross element but a respective sense capacity as well. Thus, the subtle sound element generates not only akasa but also the sense capacity of hearing (srotra), and so forth. Although an attractive idea, it tends to confuse the actual physical sense organ with an actual sense capacity. This may well be an old notion, but it is hard to imagine that the final philosophical  system would have settled for such a view. Still other East Asian com- mentaries offer further interpretations, according to one of which the  five subtle elements generate not only gross elements (in an accumu- lation manner) but the entire set of eleven sense and action capacities  as well.13 For Isvarakrsna and the classical tradition, however, it is clear enough that the five subtle elements are only generative of the five gross elements (and not the various sense and action capacities), although the manner of derivation was evidently a continuing matter of debate. All specific objects (visaya) in the phenomenal empirical world of ordinary experience are collocations or aggregations of the various
gross elements and are never themselves numbered as basic principles. 

Given these various distinctions regarding their derivation, the initial listing of 25 principles may now be more precisely exhibited in a chart.

Principles (5) through (15), and (21) through (25) are generated products (vikara, SK 3).14 Principles (3), (4), and (16) through  (20) are both generative and generated (prakrti-vikrti, SK 3). Princi- ple (2) is generative but ungenerated (avikfti), and (1) is neither gene- rative nor generated (na prakrtir na vikrtih purufah, SK 3).

The set of 3. Principles (3), (4), and (5), namely, intellect, egoity,  and mind, taken together are referred to as the "internal organ" (antah- karana, SK 33), and their three respective functions are "reflective  discerning" (adhyavasaya), "self-awareness" (abhimatia), and "inten- tionality" [samkalpaka). Together they perform the task of intellec- tual awareness, which functions not only in immediate experience but  encompasses the past and future as well (SK 33).

The set of 10. Items (6) through (10), and (11) through (15), namely, the five sense capacities and the five motor functions, taken together are referred to as the "external organ" (bdhyakarana, SK 33), and their respective activities provide mere sensings (alocanamatra, SK 28), namely, hearing, touching, and so forth; and basic motor  skills, namely, speaking, grasping, and so forth (SK 28). These ope- rate only in immediate or present experience (SK 33).

The set of 13. Items (3) through (15), namely, intellect, egoity, mind, the five sense capacities, and the five motor functions, taken  together are referred to as the "thirteenfold instrument" (trayodasa- karana, SK32), or what is often called simply the "essential core"  (linga, SK 40), which is the presupposition for all experience. The
"thirteenfold instrument" or lifiga functions as a whole by "seizing" (aharana) (presumably through the motor capacities), "holding"  (dharand) (presumably through the sense capacities), and "illuminat- ing" (prakaia) (presumably through the "internal organ") (SK 32).15  The tenfold "external" divisions of the linga are referred to as the "doors" (dvara) of awareness, and the three divisions of the "internal organ" are referred to as the "door-keepers" (dvarins) (SK 35).

The set of 17. Items (4) through (20) represent the structure of  egoity (ahamkara), and it should be noted, therefore, that "self-aware- ness," according to Samkhya philosophy, is a complex phenomenon  encompassing mental states (mind, sense capacities, and motor func- tioning) and physical components (the subtle elements).16

The set of 18. Items (3) through (20), namely, intellect, egoity, mind, the five sense capacities, the five motor functions, and the five subtle elements, taken together are referred to as the "subtle body" (,lirigaiarira or sUksmaiarira), which is detachable from any particular gross body and is, therefore, capable of transmigration in a continuing  series of gross embodiments.17 Gross bodies (sthulasarira) are one- time-only aggregations of gross elements. In the case of human gross  bodies, these are genetically derived from mother and father (with hair, blood, and flesh from the maternal line, and bone, tendon, and marrow from the paternal line). Such human gross bodies are "womb  born" (jarayuja) and become enlivened when linked with a transmigrat- ing "subtle body." There are also "egg born" (antfaja), "seed born"  (udbhijja) and "moisture born" (svedaja) gross bodies for other sorts of sentient beings (and see Tuktidifiika, p. 120 on SK 39).

## (B) Enumerations relating to the fundamental predispositions (bhava).

The set of 8. Inherent to the intellect, in addition to its basic tattva nature of reflective discerning, is a set of 8 fundamental predispositions (bhava) or instinctual tendencies that guide the life-trajectory of a sentient being, namely:

1. the predisposition toward meritorious behavior (dharma)

2. the predisposition toward knowledge (jndna)

3. the predisposition toward nonattachment (vairagya)

4. the predisposition toward power (aiivarya)

5. the predisposition toward demeritorious behavior (adharma)

6. the predisposition toward ignorance (ajnana)

7. the predisposition toward attachment (avairagya)

8. the predisposition toward impotence (anaisvarya) (SK 23)

Whereas reflective discerning represents the material dimension of  buddhi, the fundamental predispositions represent the "efficient" possi- bilities of the buddhi. The fundamental predispositions, therefore, are
