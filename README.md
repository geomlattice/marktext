Marktext is a project that aims to bring GPU accelerated terminals like Kitty and Alacritty immersive reading experiences powered by markdown and viu in unix command line interfaces. As one reads, hand crafted experiences appear before one's eyes and the ability to take notes on the fly is offered. Paired with an annotated re-read feature, marktext is sure to enhance reading experience while delivering lightning fast and light solutions to an ever expanding range of user concerns.

There are two ways to engage with this project as an external viewer through the web browser.

1. Read the full text markdown: Read Along if you'd like. It's a library too.

2. Look at what is in note directories within each text folder: these are more akin to reading commentary and reactions that one would find in margins. 

For now the content of note directories are my own reactions and comments, but when I go through Aristotle's Organon while researching the Categories it will be interesting to layer in the various voices from Alexander of Aphrodias(sic?), Sergius of Reshaina, Ibn Sina, Don Scotus, Leibniz, and Kant.  

These markdown files are intended to be data that can be used in scripts but also experienced easily by most devices with web browsers and an internet connection. There is a balance here between optimizing for command line bliss and ease of access more broadly. I am attempting to structure everything so that these seeming dualities become monadic and reach a nice harmony.

Such is the manner in which the Chaldean Oracles have been made accessible, though largely incomplete. Nonetheless, enough was quoted to bring about a scandal, in my eyes, on the question of the Trinity whether Nicea was a Late Platonic Turn. Does Porphyry really haunt the depths of Augustine of Hippo?
