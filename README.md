[Economy and Nature in the Fourtheenth Century](./book_introductions/Economy_and_Nature_in_the_Fourteenth_Century/full_text.md)

Feudalism didn't end, and Capitalism sure didn't end it. The Economy as we know it likely has been built upon the foundatiaon of Scholastic Engagements with Aristotle that created a new vision of Exchange and with it Nature. During the Era of Second Scholasticism, Economics was mutated with talk of Chinese Culture before Calculation became the new Mythology alongside the Barter Myth, though our matrices and tensors do come from Fangcheng cultivated and reformed in the Scientific Universities of the Royal Sciences. Preformation of the Embryo tempted the imagination of those well versed in Second Scholastic Semiotics. With the fixation on progenation that Property retained after the Fancy for Fine China in tea ware and Politcal Theory, Nature became the Selector in Social Darwianism, and genes would justify whatever tensions the Witch Hunts nailed into the Flesh of the Socius. The Categories of Social Being have a history that is often obscured to us, and there is more to say that I yet do not know. Apophantic Principles must remain paramount especially when the Question of the Categories is to be approached.


[Spinoza contra Phenomenology](./book_introductions/Spinoza_contra_Phenomenology/full_text.md)

The way Spinoza is taken up by Deleuze and Althusser may have just been their special way of responding to the Phenomenology of the Marburg School of which Husserl is said to be a member

[Hegel on Being](./book_introductions/Hegel_on_Being/full_text.md)

Hegel's Science of Logic is a work wherein the Categories are interrogated and this is the focus of Houlgate's study.

[Leibniz and the Kabbalah](./book_introductions/Leibniz_and_the_Kabbalah/pages/full_text.md)

Leibniz has long been seen an Arch-Rationalist, some claiming that Aristotle's Logic was the foundation of his thinking. However, he was close with the son of the Great Inheritor of Paracelus' Response to the Galenic Medical System of the Scholastic Elite, something that the Chinese Literati were not too keen on themselves. Von Helmont contributed to the study of gases, and I wonder if the Ideal Gas law does not stand as a sort of completion of the great drama that began with a Physican who wanted healthcare for the peasants, beyond just practicing for the elite. He drew on alchemy, which has a history that reaches into the depths of Islamicate Culture, and soon the New Organon would get mixed into it all: for did Bacon too not contribute to the individualization of the coming to know Nature through the research programme? So little of this is of value in the domain of clear facts, but it is exactly these confusions that motivate me to read along the path forged here in this text.

[Gate of Heaven](./book_introductions/Gate_of_Heaven/pages/full_text.md)

Spinoza, too, has long been regarded as the Pinnacle of Clear and Sober reason, for why else would he take a geometric formualation in his presentation in latin as is often voiced. Yet the influence of a particular expression of the Kabbalah may have purchase over Spinoza in some way.

[Sufism and Deconstruction](./book_introductions/Sufism_and_Deconstruction/pages/full_text.md)

Ian Almond has written on Leibniz and Islam if I am not mistaken. Here he takes on Derrida and situates him with Ibn Arabi. Something striking awaits here, I should be sure of it.

[Spirituality and Decolonial Thinking](./book_introductions/Secularism_as_Misdirection/Spirituality_and_Decolonial_Thinking/full_text.md)

This draws on Mbembe's understanding of Decolonial Thinking and Wynter's engagement with Fanon to examine the tensions of secularism in a world ensnared by colonality and discusses Decolonial Sprituality in light of this context. This is a brief preview of the Introduction and therefore only a fragment. The cited Mbembe text is avaialble here under the interview directory.

### Interviews

[Mbembe Decolonial Anxieties in a Postcolonial World] (./interviews/Decolonial_anxieties_in_a_postcolonial_world/full_text.md)

Something always escapes Calculation. Yet there are those who seek to aid Capital in Compuationalizing Everything down to the molecules in the neurons...This One True Religion aesthetic reminds me of Leibniz, but I am nowhere near well read enough to declare anything as more than an erroreous hiccup best left unwritten. Classical Logic and Linear Algebra have replaced Aristotle as the foundations of the Pseudo-Secular Religious lessons. There are more knowledges beyond what Orientalist Colonality Dreams to Accumulate as Knowledge in the service of Exchange.

### Essays 

[Benjamin Capitalism as Religion](./essays/Benjamin_Capitalism_as_Religion.md)

Benjamin was really on the Mysticsm stuff. Capital is the Cult of Infinite Guilt and the Obliteration of Being. If only he could have known that the boat would admit him the next day. He reminds us that real talent and insight can fade so quickly under the wrong tensions. So much has been left unwritten. Are we all stupider and madder for it? Do we inhabit the case wherein all that was Golden was Subdued before it could blossom? Even with Galois, a duel set Math back. Revolutionaries die too quickly to effect the deep change they yearn for sometimes. Yet that proximity to eviseration, that straddlement of the line between order and chaos: is that not the source of all that is great? Is this not what Criticality looks like? We weep but the process knows only probablities of success on the scale of the ensemble. Beings are not for us to shed tears over when Being is being Obliterated by beings becoming. The saint must be irritated with caution, for in this world of constitutive toxin there is a fractal eternity of agony to get caught in all domains. This is the horror of the expanse that lies within each monad...


[Aristotle and Pseudo-Dionysius in the Syriac Tradition](./essays/Aristotle_and_Pseudo_Dionysius_in_Syriac_Tradition/pages/full_text.md)

After discovering Pseudo-Dionysius in the Syriac Tradition, I looked at Aristotle altogether differently and came to realize that the Greek Philosophy of the Late Platonic Era did not end, but was carried forth with mutation into a novel form of Christianity that was not under the weight of the Councils and all the rest after 500CE or so due to Nestorius. This seeded much of the Tradition that comes to Baghdad. Later on Iberia will serve as a zone in which Scholastics come into contact with this tradition. Finance and Exchange continually show themselves to have traces back to encounters with this tradition and culture that has forged its logic through the Organon. The question on algebra and the Sanskrit innovations alongside Hindu Numerals cannot be understood without what Syriac contributed as a foundation for the Categories that were mutated by these techniques of the imagination and the differentiation of the diagrammatic. The formation of the Monad from the Trinity spans a Neopythagoreanism that has been split and remorphed through several traditions. Nicholas of Cusa will come to be situated in a tradition that draws on Latin Neopythagoreanism drawing on Boethius while in a world that has become enthralled by the New Aristotlian texts from Arabic. When he reads the Quran in order to find common ground between the Catholics and those of the Islamicate World, he is not aware of the importance of Syraic. Hebrew suffoctates the imagination for so long in the history of Christianity as it imagines its origins, and yet may Jesus have spoken Aramiac? In terms of the development of the Theological System, Aramiac is so much more motive than anything enuciated in Hebrew. As soon as one locates the force or dipole moment of sorts tha Aramiac has had since the time of Plato and Aristotle, they must then hold attention for the fact that so many of the linguistic idiosyncratic moments of the Quran become clear when situated alongside the Syriac of the Peshitta. Let us remember that this Peshitta was not subject to the interpretative regulations of the Byzantines, Justinian and all the rest. Nicholas of Cusa set about a Bible study and a study of The Recitation in Latin. He did not embark upon this venture with an eye to these languages beyond him. Yet, as I think is shown in the essay here, strong reason to pay attention to how Arabic thinking will come to be so dramatically shaped by Aramiac Culture and the Pseudo-Dionyisan Thrust that Cusa himself could not have been a stranger to!

### Highlights

[Palamas Triads](./highlights/Palamas_Triads.md)

example of highlight with commentary without effort to preserve text data. 

Such is the manner in which the Chaldean Oracles have been made accessible, though largely incomplete. Nonetheless, enough was quoted to bring about a scandal, in my eyes, on the question of the Trinity whether Nicea was a Late Platonic Turn. Does Porphyry really haunt the depths of Augustine of Hippo?

### Research: Samkhya: Larsons: Philosophy of Samkhya

[Preliminary Remarks](./research/samkhya/larson_introduction_to_samkhya/philosophy_of_samkhya/preliminary_remarks/full_text.md)

[I Samkhya as Enumeration](./research/samkhya/larson_introduction_to_samkhya/philosophy_of_samkhya/I_Samkhya_as_Enumeration/full_fragment.md)

This work is intended to be deeply integrated into a research and writing process. Concepts-as-datastrutures will map to the markdown files for pages. Writing will occur in a command line interface where concepts can be referenced in manner where the citation-chain can be followed clearly. Error correction hopefully will be more easy to exact across time or across perspectives. In addition to the notes folder, there will be a writings folder that draws on notes. This gives the writing a reference layer to highlights and margin notes, which themselves have a reference layer back to the markdown text that can be read by both human eyes(with some html or rich text support) and code as data. 

# Notes on the Project

These markdown files are intended to be data that can be used in scripts but also experienced easily by most devices with web browsers and an internet connection. There is a balance here between optimizing for command line bliss and ease of access more broadly. I am attempting to structure everything so that these seeming dualities become monadic and reach a nice harmony.
