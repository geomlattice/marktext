With new hybrids, these new “monsters,” the modern dichotomy created between natural laws and political representation can no longer withstand serious scrutiny.

In Early Modern Europe, in an era of primitive capitalist accumulation, travel- ers and scientists were in close correspondence and formed cosmopolitan networks.  Speaking in terms of Europe and being cosmopolitan did not exclude national senti- ment even as early as the sixteenth century, whether in collecting or writing patriotic  sentiment; and imperial hopes were clearly expressed.38 Religious aspirations were also inherent to Orientalism. There was as yet no difference between religion and science, and it was acceptable to observe as a modern and to have religious faith, as  Postel’s path demonstrates.39 A century later Pierre Gassendi wrote in order to rec- oncile modern observation and skepticism with religion; Abelard had tried centuries  before him to marry reason to faith and was condemned. One life exemplifi es all the  dimensions of the nonmodern orientalist quest very clearly. One of the most cosmo- politan of Europeans, with an agenda for France and his king, was the inimitable and  mysterious Guillaume Postel, the king’s royal professor in mathematics and Arabic. Through an overview of the complexity of Postel’s thought and remarkable destiny, the book opens with what many consider to be the beginnings of Orientalism in France.
