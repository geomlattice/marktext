the teeming material life of the earth. Herrera uses the Lurianic notion of simsum (shrinking, withdrawal, or self-limitation) to explain how the inviolate unity of 'Ein-Sof makes the metaphorical space called 'Awir Qadmon (Primordial Air or Ethe r) into which this ema na ted first effect can be proj ected, a space that will be fill ed with the worlds that this first effect crea tes by the power of its Cause. Simultaneous with the creation of this space is a cosmic dynamic of emerging and returning light, a systole/ diastole of illumination or being that runs up and down the hierarchy of crea tion from top to  bottom, and from bottom to top, according to the on-going pro- ductive will and operation of 'Ein-Sof.
