receptacles and vessels or, as they are called, kelim, 'awir, and hal- lel [vessels, air, and prais e], in no way different from sunlight, which  produces diverse, colored lights through diverse media and colors and is imprinted diversely on many mirrors and subjects. "

Having established this configuration of emanated being, 'Ein-Sof acts through the instrumental sefirot to produce the worlds that are progressively more accessible to human understanding. They are beri'ah, the seat or throne of glory upon which the Deity is seated, surrounded by the Holy Living Beings of the prophet Ezekiel's vision; yesirah, the world of formation that is the realm of angels and other incorporeal spirits, including celestial beings ; and 'asiyah, the world of making, which is the material world of the earth. Herrera describes the production of these lower worlds in a midrash or interpretation of the creation story of Genesis; as a philosophical syncretist, he explains the same process in the language of Aristotelian causation  and Neoplatonic emanation, stressing that 'Ein-Sof is intimately con- nected to all its effects and not just that which emanates directly  from it. 'Adam Qadmon therefore has various aspects, each of which is reflective of one kind of activity: "Insofar as he is the unity of unities, which are like the crowns or centers of all non-material essences, 'Adam Qadmon produces the infinite world in which the sovereign lights are resplendent. Insofar as he is the first intelligible, which contains and encompasses all ideas and forms that represent and cause all things, he projects, by emanation, the world of 'asilut which includes the divine sefirot in itself. Insofar as this 'Adam Qadmon is mind, he creates beri'ah the seat of glory which consists of pure minds, separated from matter; insofar as he is life and form, he creates yesirah the angelical world, which are the movers and souls of the other superior bodies ; and insofar as he is an essence,  which is the part of him that is the last and least perfect in the pro- gression, he makes the material world of 'asiyah which in compar- ison to the others is very imperfect but perfectible, and is eventually  perfected by the higher ones, as essence is by life, the intelligible mind, and unity" (Book VIII, Chapter 16). The three created worlds, then, are "efficient and exemplary sources of the three that are like  animate or mental instruments by which the infinite First Cause pro- duces, rules, and perfects everything" (Book VIII, Chapter 13).

When it comes to working out the analogies between Herrera's Lurianic understanding of the relationship between the higher and the lower levels of reality and their Neoplatonic counterparts, the
