# Elements of Herrera's Kabbalah

The key to understanding why Herrera's work made an impact on thinkers like Spinoza, Leibniz, the Cambridge Platonists, and the German Idealists , is the syncretistic nature of his thinking, which blends the esoteric and the philosophical, the rich tradition ofJewish  mysticism and the double current of Platonic and Aristotelian meta- physics. More than anything else, it was this aspect of Herrera's  thinking that brought him to the attention of a broad intellectual community, assuring that he would not remain a subject of interest only to kabbalists and students of the Jewish mystical tradition or marrano history. An overview of his sources and the three principal concepts that underlie his work will provide the background for a summary of his later historical influence.

As was pointed out above, Herrera stood at the crossroads of two specifically early-modern traditions: the metaphorical esoteric system developed by Isaac Luria in the early- to mid-sixteenth century, and  early-modern philosophical syncretism, that is, the process of recon- ciliation of Dominican, Franciscan, and Augustinian theology with  pagan,Jewish, and Islamic thought that culminated in the the fifteenth- century with Ficino and Pico and was carried on in the Counter  Reformation humanism of Francesco Patrizi, Giulio Camillo, the Ferrariensis, and Francisco Suarez, among others. In this respect Herrera's stated mentor among kabbalists was Moses Cordovero, as he says at the beginning of Gate if Heaven: "the wise Cordovero [who] takes from and develops philosophical arguments from Avicenna,  R. Moses of Egypt [Maimonides] and his followers, in order per- suasively to present and elaborate the kabbalistic truth which teaches  as I have done, and I make use of the statements and arguments of Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and other theologians and
philosophers without debating their efficacy, so that they enjoy the esteem that the most learned and pious men will grant them and,  founded on the infallible Truths of the kabbalah or divine recep- tion , embrace another , greater one, the better to illustrate and state  them" (Book IV, Chapter 6).

Herrera's system can be analyzed in three categories: I . the nature  and activity of the transcendent Cause; 2. procession, including ema- nation and creation and the Lurianic doctrine of simsum; and 3.  reversion and restoration, including the Lurianic doctrines of sebi- rah ha-kelim (the shatt ering of the vessels) and tiqqun ha-parsufim  (restoration of the faces).

1. Transcendent Cause: At the top of the order of reality is 'Ein Sof the Infinite, the One, the Good, the First Cause and the Prim e Mover. It is uncaused,  utterly simple, undivided and indivisible, self-consistent, and self- sufficient: in its utter transcendence it is hidden from human under- standing. As Herrera puts it: "a bove all unities of unions and of  individuals, and also above all improving and improved goods, there exists the pure and most simple One and the surp assing uncaused divine goodness which is 'Ein-Sof, the limitless origin al source of all things" (Book VI, Chapter 10). The conceptualization is a union of the God of the Hebrew Bible with the metaphysical und erstanding  of the absolute reality that exists abov e all individual being as devel- oped by Plato and Aristotle and their followers, culminating in the  Neoplatonism of Plotinus and Proclus and the scholastic theology of Aquinas, Durandus, Duns Scotus, and Suarez.

2. Pro cession (Gk. proodos, Heb. hitpastut) This absolute being causes everything that exists, because it is one  of its characteristics to be manifested. Its man ifestation is accom- plished by an essentially two-stage process. In the first stage , it gives  rise to an entity that is in all respects identical to it, except that it is not infinite but finite, without this implying any diminishment of its being or power, and without imputing any duality to the absolute  unity of its cause. This process is called emanation, and by it a sin- gle being emerges from the First Cause. Like its Cause, this being  is perfect and powerful, but because, unlike its Cause, it is also lim- ited, it has the ability to bring about the existence of all oth er things,  that is, the worlds of plurality, beginning with the highest, most pure and powerful incorporeal beings (the angels) and extending down to
the teeming material life of the earth. Herrera uses the Lurianic notion of simsum (shrinking, withdrawal, or self-limitation) to explain how the inviolate unity of 'Ein-Sof makes the metaphorical space called 'Awir Qadmon (Primordial Air or Ethe r) into which this ema na ted first effect can be proj ected, a space that will be fill ed with the worlds that this first effect crea tes by the power of its Cause. Simultaneous with the creation of this space is a cosmic dynamic of emerging and returning light, a systole/ diastole of illumination or being that runs up and down the hierarchy of crea tion from top to  bottom, and from bottom to top, according to the on-going pro- ductive will and operation of 'Ein-Sof.

Herrera calls this first effect the infinite world ('olam ha-'ein-sof) or mahsabah (mind): "we say that the infinite world which is the most perfect effect of the infinitely perfect First Cause is the mind or mahsabah of all the worlds, what the Platonic philosophers call the mental world , Son of God, and first mind, and Zoroaster calls fatherly and deep, in which they locate the causative represent ational unities and ideas to which the supreme unity and unmoving mind correspond in man" (Book VIII, Chapter 14).24 Kabbalah gives this first mind the anthropomorphic configuration of 'Adam Qadmon,  the Primordi al Man , and ascribes to it the power of producing every- thing that comes after it in the universal hierarchy: following the  distinction made in the Tiqqunei ha-Zohar, where 'Ein-Sof is the cause of all causes, 'Adam Qadmon is the cause of causes."

It is important to rem emb er that this first stage of the divine self-manifestation is not strictly speaking a creative act but rather an act of ema nation or procession: a free, uncoerced outftowing of its essence that results in the existence of the first effect which in turn
is responsible for crea tion in the proper sense of the word. Because of the special relationship that this first effect or 'Ada m Q admon has with his Cause, he sha res directly in the Cause's limitless power, which gives him the ability to create furth er effects out of nothing. The effects are the sefirot: the metaphorical lights or members of  his own body. The sefirot constitute a sepa rate rank or level of exis- tence called the world of ema nation ('olam ha-tasilut); they are anal- ogo us to Plato's Forms or Ideas and, with some differ en ces, to  Aristotle's universals; they are also more or less identical in nature and activity to Proclus's henads."

Kabbalah introduces a furth er, internal differentiation of the sefirot into those that belong to the infinite world of the essence of 'Adam Q admon (called the sefirot of the 'aqud im or bound ones), which can be thought of as the models of a second rank of crea tive sefirot, and these very ones that are the effects of the sefirot of the 'aqudim. Called the sefirot of the ema na ted world or of the nequdim or points, they are the on es that bear the names and attributes of which so mu ch kabbalistic discourse is filled , whereas their mod els in the  infinite world are, like their ultimate source, nam eless and unname- able." In this way 'Ada m Q admon , the first effect of the First Cause,  is said to contain within himself the plurality of the worlds that result  from the creative activity of the lower sefirot, which in this capac- ity are called instrument s or vessels. Thus "the unique unlimited  being is multiplied and limited to many diverse, finite effects by mean s of the many limited essences that receive it in themselves like
receptacles and vessels or, as they are called, kelim, 'awir, and hal- lel [vessels, air, and prais e], in no way different from sunlight, which  produces diverse, colored lights through diverse media and colors and is imprinted diversely on many mirrors and subjects. "

Having established this configuration of emanated being, 'Ein-Sof acts through the instrumental sefirot to produce the worlds that are progressively more accessible to human understanding. They are beri'ah, the seat or throne of glory upon which the Deity is seated, surrounded by the Holy Living Beings of the prophet Ezekiel's vision; yesirah, the world of formation that is the realm of angels and other incorporeal spirits, including celestial beings ; and 'asiyah, the world of making, which is the material world of the earth. Herrera describes the production of these lower worlds in a midrash or interpretation of the creation story of Genesis; as a philosophical syncretist, he explains the same process in the language of Aristotelian causation  and Neoplatonic emanation, stressing that 'Ein-Sof is intimately con- nected to all its effects and not just that which emanates directly  from it. 'Adam Qadmon therefore has various aspects, each of which is reflective of one kind of activity: "Insofar as he is the unity of unities, which are like the crowns or centers of all non-material essences, 'Adam Qadmon produces the infinite world in which the sovereign lights are resplendent. Insofar as he is the first intelligible, which contains and encompasses all ideas and forms that represent and cause all things, he projects, by emanation, the world of 'asilut which includes the divine sefirot in itself. Insofar as this 'Adam Qadmon is mind, he creates beri'ah the seat of glory which consists of pure minds, separated from matter; insofar as he is life and form, he creates yesirah the angelical world, which are the movers and souls of the other superior bodies ; and insofar as he is an essence,  which is the part of him that is the last and least perfect in the pro- gression, he makes the material world of 'asiyah which in compar- ison to the others is very imperfect but perfectible, and is eventually  perfected by the higher ones, as essence is by life, the intelligible mind, and unity" (Book VIII, Chapter 16). The three created worlds, then, are "efficient and exemplary sources of the three that are like  animate or mental instruments by which the infinite First Cause pro- duces, rules, and perfects everything" (Book VIII, Chapter 13).

When it comes to working out the analogies between Herrera's Lurianic understanding of the relationship between the higher and the lower levels of reality and their Neoplatonic counterparts, the
picture becomes more complicated. In one respect, there is a one- on-one correspondence between the three highest elements of the  Luriani c world and Plotinus's three hypostases: 'Ein-Sof is the One,  'Adam Qadmon and his sefirot and parsufim (the world of emana- tion) are Mind (Nous: the world mind or intelligible world); and the  worlds of beri 'ah , yesirah, and 'asiyah are Soul (Psuche: the anima mundi or world soul), although it is difficult not to assume that Herrera intends a furth er division by which the incorp oreal worlds correspond to Plotinus's third hypostasis (Being; to 6n), while 'asiyah corresponds to the even lower level of Nature . Herrera devotes much of his book to proving the analogies of 'Ein-Sof to the One and 'Adam Qadmon to Nous; as Altmann has shown, the third analogy  is more difficult. The explana tion that relates most directly to tri- partite Neoplatonic schemes associates beri'ah with Mind and 'Adam  Qadmon; yesirah with Soul, and the lights of the world of 'Ein-Sof; as well as 'asiyah with "the divine body," that is Being and 'asilut in general (Book VIII, Chapter 13).28 Herrera also turn s to Aristotle  toward the end of Gate ifHeaven to spell out a complex set of analo- gies between the sefirot and (among oth er things) the three causes  defined in the Physics. Like the Prim e Mover, ' Ein-Sof can be under- stood in this sense to work thro ugh H esed as effi cient cause, Din  (Geburah) as formal cause, and Raharnim (T if 'eret) as final cause (Book VIII , Chapter 16). Herrera also quotes Pico della Mirandola to suggest another arrangement in which the First Cause functions as the eminent cause of all things, the sefirot as their formal cause, and the three lower worlds as their parti cipative cause. 

3. Reversion (Gk. epistrofe, Heb. histalqut).

The final stage in the cosmic process described by Herrera's Lurianic kabbalah falls under the rubric of reversion and restoration. It accounts  for the origin of the existence of the lower world s, including imper-
fection and evil, by the metaphor of a universal breaking or shat- tering of the perfection of divine being when it is communicated  downward, toward the realm of pure physicality. For Luria, this phe- nom enon called sebirah or shattering takes place only among the  seven lower sefirot which because of their "inferiority" are unable to retain the force of the light that originally issues from )Adam Qadmon. The first step in Herrera's explanation is the distribution of light in the formative shape of a macrocosmic man configured with the parsufim or faces (which are further anthropomorphic configurations of the sefirot) and complete with an imating soul and spirits. The shattering of these configurations can now be understood  to result in the metaphorical fall of the broken pieces of the instru- mental sefirot kelim or vessels (also called the kings that die in the  process of disintegration). These pieces are called qelippot (literally, "husks" or "shards") that are also the source of evil; they fall from the world of emanation (metaphorically speaking) into the worlds of creation, introducing disorder, disobedience, and sin. In order for the broken unity and perfection of reality to be repaired, the upper world must be conc eptually and spiritually restored to its original place in the form of compl ete parsufim. This is the process of the restoration of the faces or tiqqun ha-parsufim, which is analogous to the Neoplatonic epistrofe or return of being to its source in the  transcendent One, and is accomplished by the prayers and inten- tions of Israel. Book X provides lengthy descriptions and details of  this process, which in a sense is the culmination of kabbalistic con- templation; Herrera reconcil es it with Luria's doctrine of the spark  and the lights, of straight and circular movement, of the right and left sides and the front and back of )Adam Qadmon.

Other aspects of Herrera's kabbalah (including the doctrine of the  levels of soul and spirit, geometric metaphors, and number combi- nation) are best left to the author himself, and to comments in the  footnotes. It is appropriate to end this survey with Herrera's own warning, in Book VII , Chapter 5: "All of this is clearly understood from what we have said, and although none of the examples that have been given are entirely identical or sufficient, if we take one part that is similar [i.e. to kabbalistic teaching), leaving aside those from which it differs, and if we did the same with all, something very close to the received truth would undoubtedly emerge. At this point we should be silent, for in such hidden and sublime matters, any information, even imprecise, must be esteemed and valued."
# Herrera's Historical Importance

T he importance of Herrera's work for later kabbal ah and the his- tory of philosophy has long been recognized, and interested readers  are referred in particular to the studies by Gershom Scholem, Alexander Altmann, Nissim Yosha, Moshe Ide!, Richard Popkin , Giuseppa Saccaro Battisti, and Kenneth Kr abbenhoft.2'1 A positive  assessment of Herrera's influence would highlight his success in achiev- ing the goal of educat ing his fellow J ews in kabbalah and philoso- phy; the legacy of his work in later kabbalistic speculation (for example  in the eighteenth century Hasidic thinker Moses Luzzatt o); and his posthumous role as spokesman for Lurianic kabbalah to the Christian world , including the possible influence of his ema nationist system on Spinoza, Leibniz, Henry More, Jacob Brucker , and the German  Idealists." It is also imp ortant to take into account the negative eval- uation of Herrera's work that stemmed from his undeserved associ- ation, in the seventeenth and eightee nth centuries, with Sabbateanism,  pantheism, and athei sm, usually in reference to his supposed influence  on Spinoza." T his view led to attacks on his work by nineteenth- cent ury historians like Heinrich Gratz who were hostile to kabb alah  in general and to Herrera's kabbalah in particular"

Gershom Schol em was responsibl e for the first objective modern evaluations of Herrera's work and influence. Recent studies by the scholars mentioned abo ve have focused on Herrera's place in the  history of Seph ardic culture; his position on the millenialist contro- versy of the early sevent eenth century; the nature of his philosoph- ical syncretism; and his contribution s to early-mode rn European  thought.
