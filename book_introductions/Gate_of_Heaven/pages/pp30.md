# Herrera's Historical Importance

T he importance of Herrera's work for later kabbal ah and the his- tory of philosophy has long been recognized, and interested readers  are referred in particular to the studies by Gershom Scholem, Alexander Altmann, Nissim Yosha, Moshe Ide!, Richard Popkin , Giuseppa Saccaro Battisti, and Kenneth Kr abbenhoft.2'1 A positive  assessment of Herrera's influence would highlight his success in achiev- ing the goal of educat ing his fellow J ews in kabbalah and philoso- phy; the legacy of his work in later kabbalistic speculation (for example  in the eighteenth century Hasidic thinker Moses Luzzatt o); and his posthumous role as spokesman for Lurianic kabbalah to the Christian world , including the possible influence of his ema nationist system on Spinoza, Leibniz, Henry More, Jacob Brucker , and the German  Idealists." It is also imp ortant to take into account the negative eval- uation of Herrera's work that stemmed from his undeserved associ- ation, in the seventeenth and eightee nth centuries, with Sabbateanism,  pantheism, and athei sm, usually in reference to his supposed influence  on Spinoza." T his view led to attacks on his work by nineteenth- cent ury historians like Heinrich Gratz who were hostile to kabb alah  in general and to Herrera's kabbalah in particular"

Gershom Schol em was responsibl e for the first objective modern evaluations of Herrera's work and influence. Recent studies by the scholars mentioned abo ve have focused on Herrera's place in the  history of Seph ardic culture; his position on the millenialist contro- versy of the early sevent eenth century; the nature of his philosoph- ical syncretism; and his contribution s to early-mode rn European  thought.
