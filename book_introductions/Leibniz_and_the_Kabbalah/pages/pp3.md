"external" view of science and philosophy, Leibniz's logic and metaphysics are indeed connected, but his metaphysics, which includes, or is included, in his theology, came first. Loemker came to this conclusion many years ago: " ... it is significant that not only Leibniz's metaphysics but his logic and physics were developed as a foundation for his theology." 19 On a number of occasions Leibniz revealed where his priorites lay. For example, he described himself in the eyes of an imaginary visitor as follows:

> I surprised him [Leibniz] one day, reading books about [religious] contro- versies. I showed my astonishment because I had been led to believe he  was a mathematician by profession, since he had done practically nothing else while in Paris. It was then that he told me that such an idea was very  mistaken, that he had many other interests, and that his principal medita- tions involved theology. He only applied himself to mathematics, as he did  to scholastic philosophy, to perfect his understanding and to learn the art of discovering and demonstrating [truth], which he believed to be so far apart at present as to be entirely different. 20

Loemker rejects Russell's view that there were two Leibnizes, a good logician and a bad, even dishonest, theologian. In his view, Leibniz's logic, like his science, was one aspect of his larger attempt to formulate a general  science, but his conviction that a general science was possible rested on meta- physical and theological assumptions derived from such thinkers as Raymond  Lull and the circle of encyclopedists at Herborn, hardly remembered for their rationalism.21 For Loemker, it is Leibniz's refusal to ignore the complexities and inconsistencies of real life for the sake of forging a fully rational system that makes him such an enduring and sympathetic philosopher:

> His age and his own genius confirmed the logician and mathematician in him, while his devotion to fact pushed him to acknowledge the unclear,  the indistinct, and the relative, to a point far beyond the superficial clari- ties and rationalizations of the age which followed him. One must choose  between the Leibniz who recognizes the symbolic and analogical nature of human thought but seeks the universal logical and moral norms which make it possible and the Leibniz who would analyze possibility and find existence hidden within it. The choice is between his two great analogies -  mathematical relationships or psychological continuity within a phenom- enally presented environment. It is the choice of beginning either from  the pure logic of anll;lysis and failing to build a metaphysics or from the awareness of the human situation but with a willingness to proceed beyond phenomena to the principles on which they may be "well founded." To one student at least, it is the latter Leibniz, who begins with human problems and human symbols but retains the powerful tools of reason not only in mathematics and logic but in life, without sacrificing the adventure of human creativeness, who seems to offer the more fruitful philosophical answers.22
