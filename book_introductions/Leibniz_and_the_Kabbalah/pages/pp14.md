I offer new evidence to show the closeness of Leibniz and van Helmont's friendship and the reasons for their collaboration. In the next three chapters I take up three key issues in Leibniz's philosophy, his concept of monads, his attempt to establish a basis for individual freedom, and his theodicy, and I offer evidence to show how the Kabbalah contributed to the development of Leibniz's mature philosophy in each of these areas. In the final chapter I discuss the ways in which Leibniz's theories of causation and language were influenced by the Kabbalah.
