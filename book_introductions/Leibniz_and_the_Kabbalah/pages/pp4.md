Taking Loemker's lead, one must conclude that it is impossible to under- stand those "quirkier" aspects of Leibniz's thought without admitting that  metaphysics and theology played a major part in his thinking and acknowl- edging that in his effort to comprehend the meaning and purpose of life he  drew on a variety of sources from all parts of the philosophical spectrum. For example, Margaret Wilson has demonstrated that the so-called vis viva controversy is not fully comprehensible unless one realizes that Leibniz's objection to the Cartesian axiom of the conservation of motion (and not force as Leibniz argued) was motivated by Leibniz's theological and metaphysical commitment to contingency and teleology in nature.23 David Papineau makes much the same point when he points out how mistaken scholars have been who dismiss the controversy as an empty dispute over terminology.24 Leibniz himself tells us as much, making it crystal clear that metaphysics determined his science, not science his metaphysics:

> Although I am one of those who have done much work in mathematics, I have constantly meditated on philosophy from my youth up, for it has always seemed to me that here, too, there is a way to establish something sound through clear demonstrations. I had penetrated deeply into the land of the Scholastics, when mathematics and modem authors made me withdraw from it while I was still young. Their beautiful ways of explaining nature mechanically charmed me, and with good reason I despised the method of those who use only forms or faculties of which nothing is understood. But later, after trying to explore the principles of mechanics itself in order to account for the laws of nature which we learn from experience, I perceived that the sole consideration of extended mass was not enough but that it was necessary, in addition, to use the concept of jorce, which is fully intelligible, although it falls within the sphere of metaphysics.25

In a similar way, the debate about exactly what Leibniz envisaged by monads has led at least one scholar to throw up her hands and conclude the problem insoluble from a strictly rational perspective, since a monad "is a mystical concept, not only a construct of reason."26

R. E. Butts has further weakened the case for the rationalist Leibniz, whose admittedly bizarre metaphysics stemmed from his science, by perceptively pointing out that if Leibniz's mathematical and logical discoveries provided the basis for his metaphysics, how can one account for the very different conclusions other scientists derived from the same mathematical and logical theories? Referring specifically to Leibniz's discovery of infinitesimal calcu-
