tenor of Renaissance Neoplatonism and occultism in general is "a progressive reification of the immaterial. .. 44 The elaborate series of emanations described in the various neoplatonic, hermetic, and kabbalistic creation myths woven together in the rich fabric of Renaissance occultism served to explain how the one became the many or how spirit was gradually transformed into matter. Leibniz and van Helmont rejected Cartesian dualism precisely because of their allegiance to Renaissance occultism. Their friendship and collaboration was based to a large extent on their mutual indebtedness to a vitalistic world view that originated in an earlier age and came increasingly under attack with the emergence of the so-called mechanical philosophy.

Renaissance occultists, and those who followed in their footsteps like van Helmont and Leibniz, were also committed to the idea that a certain prisca theologia, or primeval philosophy, existed which God had imparted to Moses on Mt. Sinai and which had culminated in Christianity. Elements of this ancient wisdom were thought to be contained in the philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato, the Hermetica, the Sibylline Prophecies, the Ophica, and, of course, the Kabbalah.45 It was believed that if this prisca theologia could be rediscovered in its authentic, uncorrupted form, it would provide the basis for a truly ecumenical religion and bring an end, once and for all, to the terrible wars caused by religious conflicts. While nominally Christian, the various versions of this supposedly rediscovered prisca theologia offered by Pico della Mirandola, Guillaume Postel, Giordano Bruno, and Tommaso Campanella, for example, were heretical in many respects.46 As I will argue, the version van Helmont thought he had rediscovered in the Lurianic Kabbalah and which influenced Leibniz's Monadology (Leibniz's own version of the prisca theologia47) was equally heretical because it reasserted the Pelagian belief in universal salvation condemned by the Roman Catholic Church in 416 C. E. The subject of both Renaissance occultism and the search for the prisca theologia will come up repeatedly in this monograph (for example, when discussing the sources of Leibniz's Monadology in chapter four, his theodicy in chapter six, and his theories of causation in chapter seven), for it is my contention that Renaissance occultism - in all its various forms - and the search for the prisca theologia provided the basis for Leibniz's mature monadology and the rationale for his optimism. Thus, while the whole point of this monograph is to show that van Helmont's kabbalistic philosophy had a decisive influence in shaping Leibniz's Monadology, it is important to recognize the common heritage of ideas which influenced the thought of both men. Leibniz was not introduced to the Kabbalah by van Helmont; kabbalistic ideas were a part of Leibniz's intellectual heritage, and he referred to the Kabbalah, both positively and negatively, before the period of his close friendship and collaboration with van Helmont. 48 Van Helmont did, however,
