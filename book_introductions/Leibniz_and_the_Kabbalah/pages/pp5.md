Ius, which has often been seen as the foundation for his monadology, Butts remarks, "If the calculus were liable to metaphysical interpretation only in terms of Leibnizian continuity, what fools Newton and Berkeley must have been!,,27 Butts completely rejects the view of Leibniz as a rationalist and  argues instead that his philosophy is essentially a reformation of Gnosti- cism: " ... the entire intellectual career of Leibniz was an attempt to convert  what he took to be the insights and consequences of an essentially gnostic weltanschauung into publicly available scientific knowledge.,,28 Butts argues that Leibniz's idea of continuity, his idea that monads emanate from God in the form of light, and his notion that evil represents limit and privation all originate in Gnosticism:

> If I am right that the physics of forces was suggested by the organicism of Leibniz's publicly proclaimed systematic Gnosticism; if I am right that the infinitesimals are a mathematicized expression of the principle of continuity coupled with the basic idea of the monad, then I think I may also be right in suggesting that the fundamental Leibnizian notion that in all true propositions the predicate is fully contained in, or is identical with,  the subject is again the statement of a result of having accepted the God- monad-emanation-continuity metaphysics that I have sketched above. Like  Plato, Leibniz was not a "systematic" philosopher .... I do think it correct to hold, however, that Leibniz had a system, and that system was a coherent form of Renaissance Gnosticism. To want to make the ancient wisdom public, to want to have it motivate empirical inquiries - even to produce palpable practical results - was a high ambition.29

Butts is entirely right in pointing out the gnostic roots of Leibniz's phi- losophy. But instead of the somewhat vague, generic sources he cites, the  primary gnostic source for many of Leibniz's most important ideas was the Lurianic Kabbalah, which Leibniz came to know though his friendship and collaboration with Francis Mercury van Helmont.

My contention that Leibniz was influenced by the kabbalistic philosophy of Francis Mercury van Helmont rests on the fact that Leibniz's relationship with van Helmont extended over a much longer period, from 1671 to van Helmont's death in 1698, and was far closer than has previously been known. While it is true that Leibniz had a lively curiosity and a courtier's courtesy, these alone cannot explain his unusual interest in van Helmont's views. The  manuscripts in the "Helmont" collection in the Nierdersachsische Landesbib- liothek in Hanover, together with manuscripts from other collections, show  how conversant Leibniz was with van Helmont's thought. Even before they met in 1671, Leibniz knew van Helmont by reputation - he was, after all, the son of Jan Baptista van Helmont, whose work Leibniz knew well. In 1667 Leibniz mentions reading the younger van Helmont's first two books,
