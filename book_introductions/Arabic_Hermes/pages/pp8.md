Further research in Egyptology may well be able to elucidate more tangible local roots of the Hermetica in the scrolls of the Egyptian priests of the Roman period.17 Indeed, direct evidence of a possible Egyptian literary background to the Hermetica has recently emerged. In 2005 two Egyptologists, Richard Jasnow and Karl-Theodor Zauzich, published an edition of a Demotic Egyptian text containing a dialogue of instruction between the god Thoth and a student, called mr-rx, “lover of knowledge” or perhaps “philosopher.” The manuscripts, many incomplete pieces of what was once apparently a long text kept in Egyptian temple libraries, have been dated approximately to the period from the fi rst century bce to the second century ce. This is just the period during which the Greek Hermetica are generally supposed to have had their genesis. Because the contents of this Demotic Book of Thoth (so dubbed by its editors) do not exhibit an “admixture of hellenistic philosophy,” as the Greek Hermetica clearly do, the editors of the text have prudently concluded that the work is not a direct ancestor of the Greek Hermetica, though it may be rather “one of the grandfathers” of the Greek Hermetica.18 Both are dialogues between Thoth-Hermes and a pupil on theological subjects, so it is easy to imagine a connection between them, but no convincing parallel has yet been discovered, either in wording or in doctrine, despite the editors’ best efforts to do so. The assessment of the ancient author of the De mysteriis Aegyptiorum was that “those documents . . . which circulate under the name of Hermes contain Hermetic doctrines, even if they often employ the terminology of the philosophers; for they were translated from the Egyptian tongue by men not unversed in philosophy.”19 This view now seems more likely to win the day than ever before, but it will certainly require a careful comparative study by a scholar at home in both Egyptology, particularly in Demotic Egyptian, and  ancient Greek. Perhaps undiscovered Egyptian texts will contribute further to solv- ing the problem of the formation of the Greek Hermetica.

Even within Greek literature itself, there are still unexplored avenues for schol- arly research. The title Corpus Hermeticum is normally used to refer only to the  Greek philosophical Hermetica brought to light in fi fteenth-century Italy (though often in practice it also includes the text surviving complete only in Latin translation
