When it comes to the Arabic Hermetica, one fi nds in modern scholarship a highly inconsistent use of the terms Hermetic, Hermetist, and Hermetism. Because the words have ordinarily been used to refer to a putative religious group in early Roman Egypt and its works, or to occultists of early modern Europe, one might expect some critical refl ection on the meaning of these terms when applied to the very different background of early Arabic culture, and to the social realities assumed behind those terms. I have not found any such refl ection on Arabic Hermeticism. Moreover, in the context of Arabic literature, modern scholars generally use the word Hermetic to refer not just to works associated with the name Hermes, but also to all manner of works with allegedly “Gnostic,” “Neoplatonic,” “Neopythagorean,” or “esoteric” tendencies or practically any early Arabic pseudepigraph.51 Above all, it is used to refer to the beliefs of the Ṣābians of Ḥarrān, about whom very little is known, but who have been the subject of seemingly endless speculation. (Their relationship to the Hermetica is the subject of chapter 3.)

In fact, a remarkable number of the modern studies discussing Arabic Hermeticism emphasize just how vaguely defi ned it must have been. It is as if a vague defi nition of the supposed phenomenon proved that the thing itself was vague. The general unwillingness to defi ne the object means that obscure, meaningless, and sometimes simply false assertions about Hermeticism have prevailed. Some have claimed that a given Arabic author or work was Hermetic with hardly any reference to Arabic works of Hermes or any explanation of the term.52 Others allege the great “infl uence of Hermetism on Islam,”53 or oppose the “rational Aristotelianism” to the “irrational Hermeticism” in Arabic philosophy.54 Some fi nd Hermetists in fi gures that they see as marginal to an imagined Islamic orthodoxy, such as certain Šīites, alchemists, and unconventional individuals such as the tenth-century physician ar-Rāzī, or sometimes in any author who so much as cites Hermes.55 Hermetism has even been imagined as a risky belief system dangerous for its adherents because of the
