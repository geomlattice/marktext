all of his ambitions for philosophy, even the imprudent ones.” In the end, Spinozism posits a transgressive role for rational thought, “an irrational belief in reason” that makes philosophy itself an object of quasi-theological affirmation. “Whence the perverse impression that we must believe in the Ethics, and that if we don’t, then the Ethics itself will explain which mental disorder is preventing us from doing so.”

Marion’s discussion of Spinoza was consistent with the other interviews that appeared under the rubric “Le Monde des philosophes” in the newspaper’s book section throughout 2008. In each instance, the apparent idea was to have a contemporary philosopher speak on a canonical figure with whom he or she had, if not an antagonistic relationship, at the very least a fraught or conflicted one. For example, André Glucksmann, the author of a series of antitotalitarian polemics in the 1970s, had been asked to discuss Plato, a conversation that found its counterpoint the next month when the arch-Platonist Alain Badiou set his sights on Aristotle.2 The editorial decision to solicit Marion’s views on Spinoza was particularly inspired, not simply because Marion has long been recognized as France’s leading expert on Descartes, a familiar target of Spinozistic criticisms, but also because of his status as arguably the preeminent living inheritor of the phenomenological tradition in France.3 Le Monde’s choice was serendipitous for this book as well, since it resulted in an interview that clarified its core thesis at a time when it was still very much a work in progress. In their elegant simplicity, Marion’s comments not only manifested a set of irreconcilable differences between phenomenology and Spinozism; they also made clear that those differences resulted from a fundamental disagreement about the value of rationalism as a philosophical ethos.

By insisting on Spinozism’s core liability as one of transgression, a failure to respect the limits of rational thought, Marion lent his remarks a striking historical resonance. Despite their casual delivery, his censures recapitulated those Immanuel Kant leveled against Spinozism in the pages of the Berlinische Monatsschrift in 1786. Responding to suggestions that his own philosophy would lead, like Spinozism, to the ruin of morality, Kant insisted that whereas Spinoza claimed to possess knowledge of “supersensible objects,” such as God, “the Critique completely clips dogmatism’s wings.”4  For Kant, the value of the “rational faith” on offer in his philosophy was that it did not mistake itself for knowledge, a value that was especially clear when counterpoised to Spinoza’s demonstrative insistence on
