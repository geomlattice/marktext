example, that the French make no distinction between structuralism and poststructuralism, the former term alone sufficing to name a gamut of critical interrogations of philosophy and the human sciences that dominated French intellectual life in the 1960s and, to an extent, into the 1970s.9  In the American history of French Theory, the famous 1966 Johns Hopkins symposium “The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man,” which included presentations from such luminaries as Jacques Lacan and Roland Barthes, began as an episode in the reception of structuralism and ended with the advent of poststructuralism.10 The turning point occurred when Derrida presented his famous deconstruction of the elements of “play” in Claude Lévi-Strauss’s otherwise austere formalism. Events such as this established the initial terms of intelligibility for Derrida abroad, presenting him as a thinker concerned mainly with the vicissitudes of structuralist poetics.11 Recent work has made clear, however, at least until the next wave of revisionism, that Derrida is best understood as a philosopher, one responding to the challenges inherent in the phenomenological enterprise.12

None of this is to deny that there was something called “structuralism” in France or that it unified a variety of theoretical projects. But the picture of the 1960s as a moment when structuralism burst onto the scene to render existentialism obsolete, only to be replaced in turn by a poststructuralism in which leading figures of existentialism—Nietzsche and Heidegger chief among them—reemerged in a more theoretically sophisticated light is too crassly Hegelian in its form to be satisfactory. Much as recent work has established the roots of deconstruction in a longer story of phenomenology’s reception, this book provides a different view of the genealogy of structuralism by focusing on the rationalist resistance to phenomenology that reached its pinnacle in the 1960s with the philosophical projects of Louis Althusser and Gilles Deleuze. To be sure, the postwar introduction of linguistic formalism into the human sciences, from anthropology to psychoanalysis, was a transformative moment in twentiethcentury French thought. But one of the main implications of this book is that this formalism acquired the purchase it did because it resonated with the insights of a rationalism rooted in the initial French response to phenomenology in the interwar years.13

Here, some preliminary questions insist: Isn’t France’s native son René Descartes typically regarded as the father of modern rationalism? And did Paul Ricoeur not identify a “latent rationalism” as “one of the
