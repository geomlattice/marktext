shaped—or indeed deconstructed—by a French engagement that sought to decouple the method from the nefarious implications of Heidegger’s indulgence in Nazism in order to salvage it as the basis for a contemporary philosophical ethos and ethics.6  This book is a history of a countervailing strand of development in which a series of French thinkers sought to salvage rationalist philosophy from its phenomenological denigration by reconfiguring it in Spinozist terms. In their view, the travesties of modern life were not instances of rationalism run amok; they were instead consequent upon a dearth of rationalism, to the profit of myth. For the Spinozists discussed in this book, phenomenology was likewise a stimulus to thought: a negative stimulus.

Louis Althusser deployed military metaphors often and would no doubt have recognized that this book seeks to intervene on two fronts. First, it participates in the resurgence of interest in Spinoza’s philosophy in contemporary scholarship, a diverse enthusiasm that runs from Jonathan Israel’s promotion of Spinoza as the theoretical progenitor of democratic modernity to various “new materialisms” that find in Spinoza’s metaphysics the resources for an emancipatory politics of affect.7  Second, the narrative that follows aims to develop a fuller picture of twentieth-century French intellectual history, one that builds on the scholarship that has established the reception of phenomenology as the main arc in the story.

In addition to highlighting the central role of philosophy, one further consequence of this recent work has been to confirm what has long been recognized, if not explicitly thematized: “French Theory” is best regarded as a transatlantic if not global entity rather than a French one. In other words, the history of French Theory is a history that took place mainly outside France’s borders in a variety of cultural and disciplinary contexts in the Anglophone world.8  What this means is that the history of French Theory is not strictly commensurable with the history of philosophical and theoretical developments that were later disseminated under that name. In this regard, the emphasis on the local reception of phenomenology in France has yielded a more accurate historical picture of this body of thought in its original formulation, insofar as we understand historical accuracy here to mean correlating as closely as possible to what the subjects in question understood themselves to be doing. It is often remarked, for
