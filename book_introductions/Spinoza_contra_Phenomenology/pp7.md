will appreciate that such is not the aim of this inquiry. Like any canonical figure, Spinoza has garnered a more or less continuous stream of attention since the institutionalization of academic philosophy in the late modern period, and twentieth-century France is no exception to a trend that spans multiple national cultures. Key figures include Sylvain Zac and Robert Misrahi, both of whom published important assessments in the postwar period that focused on Spinoza’s moral and religious writings, precisely those aspects of his thought overlooked in the reception that is the focus here.17 And while Léon Brunschvicg, a towering figure of Third Republic philosophy, plays an important role in what follows, his contemporary Victor Delbos, who authored two major studies of Spinoza, receives no attention.18 The most striking absence to readers familiar with the field will be Alexandre Matheron, whose book Individu et communauté chez Spinoza is often cited alongside Gueroult and Deleuze’s major studies as helping to usher in a “Spinoza Renaissance” in France at the end of the 1960s.19

The issue of genre partly explains these omissions. With the possible exception of Martial Gueroult, none of the authors covered in this book could be regarded as “Spinoza specialists.” Rather, they are thinkers for whom aspects of Spinoza’s thought played an instrumental role in their own projects. Beyond the specialists, however, it will also be noted that there is no engagement with the works of Étienne Balibar, Pierre Macherey, or Antonio Negri, the Italian Marxist whose writings on Spinoza came to form a core component of contemporary French Spinozism.20 The rationale for neglecting these important figures is at once historical and theoretical. In the first place, it’s true that, following upon the open secret of Spinoza’s importance to Althusser and his students, the near-simultaneous publication of Gueroult, Matheron, and Deleuze’s studies helped bring about an efflorescence of political engagements with Spinoza’s thought that persists in France to this day.21 The intensity of this shift alone marks it as the beginning of a separate story, although the sheer volume of scholarship it has generated would also make writing an intelligible history of this contemporary period very difficult. More important is the genuine transformation in the content of Spinozism that accompanies this turn and that points to the substantive reasons for terminating the inquiry at this point. For it is only after 1968 that Spinoza’s political writings and the later sections of the Ethics, containing his writings on affect and emotion, begin to merit wider attention in France. Zac’s works notwithstanding, prior to
