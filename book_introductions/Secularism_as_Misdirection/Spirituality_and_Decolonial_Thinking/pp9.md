# Spirituality and Decolonial Thinking

From another part of the global South, Walter Mignolo names as the 'Western code' the beleif in 'one sustainable system of knowledge, cast first in theological terms' and later in secular philosophy and sciences.17 This system of knowledge is assumed to have been inaugurated by the European Enlightenment. Decolonial thinking counters this idea - that European modernity was the point of arrival of human history - and focuses on the 'colonial matrix of power' of which the 'rhetoric of modernity' and the 'logic of colonality' are the two sides.18 Coloniality is a term Mignolo derives from the Peruvian thinker Anibal Quijano, who sees it as a process inaugurated by the European invasion from the fifteenth century of the regions now called the Americans and the Caribbean. Coloniality led to the formation of these regions from kingdoms that existed at the time, and to the massive trade of enslaved Africans. Coloniality is thus constitutive of modernity, its 'darker side'.
