# Spirituality and Decolonial Thinking

From another part of the global South, Walter Mignolo names as the 'Western code' the beleif in 'one sustainable system of knowledge, cast first in theological terms' and later in secular philosophy and sciences.17 This system of knowledge is assumed to have been inaugurated by the European Enlightenment. Decolonial thinking counters this idea - that European modernity was the point of arrival of human history - and focuses on the 'colonial matrix of power' of which the 'rhetoric of modernity' and the 'logic of colonality' are the two sides.18 Coloniality is a term Mignolo derives from the Peruvian thinker Anibal Quijano, who sees it as a process inaugurated by the European invasion from the fifteenth century of the regions now called the Americans and the Caribbean. Coloniality led to the formation of these regions from kingdoms that existed at the time, and to the massive trade of enslaved Africans. Coloniality is thus constitutive of modernity, its 'darker side'.

The world around 1500 was 'polycentric and non-capitalist',19 with several coexisting civilizations - the Ming Huangdinate, the Ottoman Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, the Oyo and Benin kingdoms of the Yoruba nation in AFrica, the Incas in Tawantinsuyu, and the Aztecs in Anahuac. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the world is monocentric, interconnected by a single type of economy, capitalism; the violence of colonial practices has ravaged the world, which is now marked by a diversity of political theories and practices. In between these two scenarios, 'modernity' enters as a double colnisation of time and space. A structure of control and management has emerged, of 'authority, economy, subjectivity, gender and sexual norms', driven by the exploitation of labour and the expropriation of land.20

According to Nelson Maldonaldo-Torees a serious engagement with spirituality is a dstinguishing feature of decolonial - as opposed to postcolonial - thought. Mignolo himself is not interseted in drawing sharp lines of division between decolonial and postcolonial thought. he sees both as 'options' that can coexist, and as having different trajectories in terms of points of origin and linguistic fields, and therefore different areas of concern.21 But he does outline the 'spiritual option' as one of the trajectories that decolnial thinking will have to take seriously in the coming decades as it challenges both secular modernity/coloniality, and also the colonisation of institutionalised religions.22 Maldonaldo-Torres sees this as a distinctive feature of decolonial thinking for, while postcolonial studies emerge from and are located in the academic field of the secular humanities, decolnial thinking has not been an academic discipline alone: it has included community activists, artists, and scholars critical of modern Western secularism who have drawn from and contributed to religious studies as well.

It is from this perspective that Maldonaldo-Torees reads Fanon as offering a critique of the coloniality of the religion/secularism divide.

Rejecting the understanding of Fanon as a secularist philosopher, Maldonaldo-Torres insists Fanon did not believe that overcoming religion is a necessary for decolonisation to take place, or that decolonisation would lead to religionless soceity. This is reflected, he says, in a paper Fanon co-wrote with an intern, Jacques Azoulay, while Fanon was Director of the Blida Psychiatric Hospital in Algeria. The paper warns psychiatrists and other scientists that while 'some conducts, some reactions can appear 'primitive' to us ... that is only a value judgement, one that is both questionable and bears on poorly defined characteristics.' The authors were, in particular, referring to the idea that 'genies'(jinn) produce madness, a bleief prevalent in Algeria.23 Maldonlado-Torres concludes that Fanon's 'view of the self as a gift and his intersubjective account of healthy individuality and social relations, draw from and are compatible with a large variety of sources, including so-called religious or spiritual formations.'24 Fanon's decolonial thinking should therefore be related to 'non-secular or post-secular accounts of reality, including the African diaspora spiritualities that are found in Fanon's own island of Martinique and through the Caribbean, some of which probably informed Fanon's thinking and worldview too.' It seems, too, that Fanon is read quite widely as a critic of the coloniality of secularism among militant intellectuals in the Indigenous communities of South America.25 

In a similar move, but from a position different from that of Mignolo, Achille Mbembe reasserts a 'critical and inclusive universalism' as the 'latest avatar of a certain tradition of Western humanism.' In an interview around his book, Brutalisme(2020), Mbembe reflects on the shift that has taken place from the beginning of modernity - when 'the sharp separation between the world of humans and the world of objects' was an emancipatory move - to the current moment when what 'prevails is the idea that the human is the product of technology' and '[e]verything, including consciousness itself, is

being reduced to matter.'26 Mbembe terms this the 'new secular religion,' counterposing to it the non-dichotomy of precolonial African and Amerindian metaphysics which enables us to 'de-dramatize the human/object relationship.'27 At the same time Mbembe is concerned that the 'critique of reason' should not become 'a war against reason', and it is in this context that he asserts the new critical universalism.

In the present book I attempt to assert multiple notions of reason and unreason, as well as a somewhat suspicious attitude towards universalism. The point, however, that emerges from these different sets of not necessarily congruent arguments is the idea of 'applying theory' produced in one context to 'understand practice' in another assumes that 'politcal practice' is 'non-theoretical' - completely bereft of any discursive-theoretical content - so that any theory (from the West) can be used to make sense of politcal practice anywhere. But, as some of us argued in an earlier work, all political practice is always constituted by some form of reflection and thought - theoretical or non-theoretical - and, as we realise today, at leasst one part of theorisation must be abou making sense of 'practice' through an understanding of the subject's own world and her categories of thought.28

What these layered discussion indicate is that the dichotomies of universal/particular, east/west, and tradition/modernity are articulated in far more complex ways than their invocations often imply.
