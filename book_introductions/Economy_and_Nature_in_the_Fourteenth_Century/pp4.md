cited, above all, the many dimensions of measurement involved in the central theological question of the relation of finite humanity to an infinite God.10

In explaining the new frenzy to measure qualities primarily as the  working out of problems generated from within the philosophical tradi- tion, Murdoch articulates a position on philosophical and scientific  innovation prevalent among historians of medieval science. Murdoch goes further, however, when he suggests as a third area of influence the  social and intellectual milieux of the university.11 Edith Sylla has inves- tigated this connection between philosophical speculation and its univer- sity setting in depth. She has shown the relationship between the vibrant,  sometimes fierce, ‘‘disputational context’’ of the university and the evolving mathematical and logical form of both the questions asked and  the answers considered successful in philosophical debate.12 While acute- ly conscious of the impact of scholastic society on the shape and direction  of philosophical inquiry, Sylla has limited her consideration of social factors to the society of scholars within the schools. With few exceptions, historians of medieval science have hesitated to step outside the university and outside the sphere of a refined intellectual culture in their analysis of fourteenth-century natural philosophy.13
