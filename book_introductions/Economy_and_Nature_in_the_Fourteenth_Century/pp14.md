the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, opposition between  the economic order and traditional models of natural order led to conti- nuing attempts (seen most clearly within scholastic usury theory) to force  economic definitions to conform to traditional definitions of ‘‘natural’’ equality.33 The distinction between natural order and market order created great tension within an intellectual culture whose habit was to unify and synthesize. The tension grew as the power and position of the market in society grew, until, by the late thirteenth century, as a result of this continued opposition, it was the conception of the natural order that began to give way.34 Scholastic natural philosophers began to create a new model of nature, one that could comprehend the order and logic of the marketplace – dynamic, self-equalizing, relativistic, probabilistic, and geometrical – a nature constructed and bound together by lines in constant expansion and contraction. It was within this new model of nature that science emerged.
