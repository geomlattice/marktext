and calculated benefit; expand the system of equilibrium from the indi- vidual exchange to the community of exchangers; and the result was,  somehow, market order and equality. What is more, from the middle of  the thirteenth century, the order established by the self-equalizing mar- ketplace of free exchangers was coming to be recognized as resistant to,  and in some ways superior to, an order imposed by decree, even when motivated by the best social intentions.28

In the religious and philosophical universe of the thirteenth century, where the existence of order necessarily, as Aquinas said, implied the existence of an active ordering intelligence,29 where in the Aristotelian universe even the movement of the celestial spheres required the constant intervention of active intelligences, there was no other system that conformed to the scholastic conception of the self-equalizing system of market exchange.30 Serious ethical and theological questions were raised by an order in which equality and justice resulted from an impersonal, almost mechanical, common process, rather than from a conscious ethical  decision on the part of individuals.31 And the model of market equaliz- ation was worse than merely impersonal. As the fourteenth century  progressed, scholastic thinkers realized that market equality was the  geometric product of willed inequalities – crossed diagonals – each ex- changer seeking to benefit more than the other from the exchange.32  Such production of order and equality out of willed inequality violated the essence of the traditional metaphysical and physical understanding of the ordo rerum.
