almost to have been on an informal bureaucratic track, with their experi- ence as administrators beginning during their university careers and  ending with exalted positions in the bureaucracies of Church or civil government.18

Within the universities, every examination taken, every grade passed  and degree earned, had a price attached to it. The surviving administra- tive records from Oxford and Paris attest to the range of fees charged  and the amount of conscious effort required of the master-scholars in the assessment and collection of these fees – for the teaching masters at the  university were in almost all cases its administrators as well.19 The mi- nute monetary regulation and gradation of university life was further  complicated by the habit of varying each fee levied in proportion to the ability of each student to pay. Again it was ordinarily the teaching masters who were charged with assessing, collecting, accounting for, and recording these fees.20 The evidence in surviving university records for continued bureaucratic involvement has led one modern scholar to conclude that university masters of the fourteenth century spent as much of their time performing administrative duties as they did writing and lecturing.21

The economic writings left by these masters (examined in chapters –) reveal how strongly their administrative experience influenced their perceptions of money and exchange. The same scholars whose economic writings are studied in this book and whose work demonstrates the  clearest insight into the structure of economic life – Godfrey of Fon- taines, Henry of Ghent, Peter John Olivi, John Duns Scotus, Geraldus  Odonis, Walter Burley, Richard Kilvington, Jean Buridan, Nicole Oresme – all made significant and forward-looking contributions in the area of natural philosophy. To take but one example, each of these thinkers played a vital role in refining the concept of qualitative intensity,
