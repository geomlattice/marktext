from a knowable and numerically definable point of equality to an estimated, geometrically defined range (or ‘‘latitude’’) of approximation. I illustrate the conflict between older arithmetical and newer geometrical  conceptions of economic equality through a heated philosophical-econ- omic debate that occurred at the end of the thirteenth century between  two Parisian masters, Henry of Ghent and Godfrey of Fontaines.

Chapter 5, the last of the economic chapters, investigates develop- ments in economic thinking that occurred over the course of the four- teenth century. The focus here is on the economic writings of those  scholars who at the same time made pivotal contributions to fourteenth- century natural philosophy: Peter John Olivi, John Duns Scotus, Walter  Burley, Richard Kilvington, Geraldus Odonis, Albert of Saxony, Jean Buridan, and Nicole Oresme. Although scholastic economic thinking has  often been characterized as abstract, unrealistic, and bounded by author- ity, a close reading of fourteenth-century texts reveals the willingness of  philosophers and theologians to reformulate economic conceptions in order to comprehend and accurately describe the changing realities of the monetized marketplace.

In the speculation considered in chapter 5, we come most forcefully to those economic insights that had the greatest influence on scientific  speculation: the recognition of money as a common measuring continu- um for all commodities in exchange; the social geometry of a world  perceived to be tied together by economic exchange and the medium of money; the comprehension of the relativist determination of all values in the marketplace; the understanding of the necessity of a mathematics of the approximate in the exchange equation; and, perhaps most important, the emerging sense of the marketplace as a dynamic, supra-personal, self-ordering system of equalization.

I have come to recognize that these insights can be organized into six conceptual categories, in each of which developments in scholastic  economic thought connect to proto-scientific speculation: (1) mathe- matics and the geometry of exchange; (2) equality, the mean, and  equalization in exchange; (3) money as medium and as measure; (4) relation and the relativity of value in exchange; (5) common valuation in  exchange; and (6) the social geometry of monetized society. The chap- ters on scholastic economic thought are divided into headings deter- mined by these categories.

The concluding chapters, 6 and 7, are focused on new directions in the  comprehension and representation of nature pursued within fourteenth- century natural philosophy. Under each of the six category headings,  defining elements of the new scholastic understanding of monetized exchange are related to specific innovations within fourteenth-century
