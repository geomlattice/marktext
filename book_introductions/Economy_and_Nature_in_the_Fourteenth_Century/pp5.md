As the reading of any text in natural philosophy from this period indicates, the great majority of positions taken and points made were in response not to external experiences or influences, but to questions and  positions defined by the ongoing debate. In this literature, logic domi- nates and leads. Evidence of direct experience in the world beyond the  text is rare. Historians of medieval science have, therefore, directed their attention primarily toward the internal elements of scholastic debate and of university culture.

While the internal analysis of texts and traditions provides the base on which all intellectual history must rest, at certain points its limitations in explaining intellectual innovation become apparent even to those most committed to its practice.14 These limitations are especially clear in the case of major shifts in perception and direction like those that defined fourteenth-century natural philosophy.15 It is difficult to see (to take one set of examples) how influences coming solely from within the schools can explain the strength of the intellectual movement of calculationes, or the preoccupation with measurement and relation that informed it, or the faith in the potential of quantification that underlay it, or the new  perceptual models of the natural world from which it arose. Under- standing intellectual innovation of this magnitude requires an approach  that focuses on the interaction between the culture of the schools and new conceptual models coming from beyond the schools â€“ in this case models that took shape as scholars directly (and sometimes painfully) experienced and sought to comprehend the dynamic of the monetized marketplace.
