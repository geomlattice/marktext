By committing an error diametrically opposite to that of the Wissenschaft des Judentums, the nationalists had fallen into the same dogmatic trap.

To borrow from Nietzsche's terminology in his Use and Abuse of History, Scholem renounces both ‘‘antiquarian” and “monumentalist’” historiography, calling instead for a “critical” historiography which would combine romantic, nationalist ideals with critical method. The Wissenschaft des Judentums started out with such a balance, but because of the contradictions imposed on it by its historical context, its critical side went out of control and became pure negation and antiquarianism. Some of the nationalists, Scholem suggests, have gone to the other extreme of pure affirmation and have also lost the critical method.

a Zionist historiography with a critical method. If the Wissenschaft des Judentums wanted to liquidate the Jewish tradition, Scholem promises a “liquidation of the liquidation” (hisul ha-hisul).’° His formulation is just close enough to Hegel’s ‘negation of the negation” to suggest to his audience his dialectical relation to his predecessors. His is not a simple negation of the past but a dialectical appropriation of it: “We wanted to return to science with all its rigor and without compromise as we found it in the writings of Zunz and Steinschneider, but we wanted to direct it towards construction and affirmation.’”! The Wissenschaft des Judentums, although enmeshed in paralyzing contradictions, nonetheless developed the secular historical method that Scholem advocates: “[Their] program would have been appropriate had it been directed towards the building of the Jewish nation.””

Just as the Sabbatian heresy had a constructive side, so the emonic element in the Wissenschaft des Judentums—its critical historica method—must be the key to future constructive historiography.
