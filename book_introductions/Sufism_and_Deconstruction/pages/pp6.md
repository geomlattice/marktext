same questioning of their clarity and coherence as thinkers (Denifle/ Affifi), the same comparisons with Far Eastern thought-systems (Suzuki, Ueda/Izutsu) . . . if one were to try and search medieval Christendom for an Ibn 2Arabi, Eckhart would appear to be the nearest alternative.

Although I have, elsewhere, gone to some trouble to show how Eckhart and Ibn 2Arabi develop from identical points of departure into ultimately different vocabularies, this abundance of comparisons  between the Shaykh and the Meister is good news for our own examina- tion of Sufism and deconstruction.15 Although Derrida has not written a  word about Sufism, he has written a great deal about Meister Eckhart. As early as 1964, within the pages of Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale, Derrida displays a revealing knowledge of ‘Maître Eckhart’’s vernacular sermons, whilst in ‘How to Avoid Speaking: Denials’ he fleshes out the elementary points he had made concerning Eckhart twenty years earlier. Naturally, this does not mean that what Derrida writes about Eckhart is automatically valid for Ibn 2Arabi as well. What Derrida’s fascination with Eckhart does do is give us an idea of where Ibn 2Arabi’s points of similarity with Eckhart (mistrust of metaphysics and rationality, insistence on openness, the idea of ‘God’ as a construct, a hidden divinity in the soul, a radically generous hermeneutics . . .) would be similarly prone to a deconstructive reading. Eckhart cannot simply be used as a handy Christian synonym for Ibn 2Arabi; the Meister  can serve, however, as a useful barometer to measure Derrida’s own hos- tility and sympathy towards the wider ideas of mysticism and negative  theology.
