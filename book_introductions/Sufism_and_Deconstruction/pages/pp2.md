Routledge’s recent History of Islamic Philosophy, it appears that Muhyiddin Ibn 2Arabi (1165–1240) is finally joining the handful of token ‘Easterners’ (Rumi, Averroes, Avicenna) known to non-experts in the West.

As often happens, this surge of popular Western attention in Ibn 2Arabi has also instigated a certain rearguard action amongst the more orthodox elements in Ibn 2Arabi scholarship. Thus a critic such as Mahmoud al-Ghorab can demonstrate, in twenty pages, how Ibn 2Arabi  was neither a Shi1ite, nor a philosopher, nor an Isma1ili, nor an esoteri- cist, nor a figure especially sympathetic to Jews and Christians, but  rather a ‘Muslim’ and a ‘Traditionalist (salafi)’.3 Even William Chittick, a towering figure in Ibn 2Arabi studies, appears wary of associating the Shaykh with modern theorists who ‘claim that language determines all of reality’.4 There is an understandable desire for context in all of this (Derrida’s ‘indispensable guardrail’),5 even if establishing exactly what that context is – and whether Ibn 2Arabi is being read in or out of it – remains easier said than done.

It is certainly not the object of this book to claim that Ibn 2Arabi was the existentialist – or post-structuralist – of all time, as Pamuk jokes. Rather, we will be trying to understand Sufism and deconstruction, to abuse an analogy from Benjamin, as different fragments belonging to the same, long-shattered vase. In dealing with texts whose origins lie almost eight hundred years and many more kilometres apart, it is not the  intention of this study to turn a thirteenth-century Sufi into a postmod- ern theorist, anymore than it is our desire to ‘islamicize’ Jacques Derrida  or transform his writings into a form of Islamic mysticism (producing a ‘Jacques of El-Biar’, as John D. Caputo has already quipped).6 Over the past fifteen years, scholars from comparative religion and theology  departments around the world have been rediscovering in their own reli- gious traditions various precedents for Derrida’s deconstructive writings,  a trend there is certainly every reason to encourage. Figures such as  Pseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhart, Sankara, Lao-Tzu and Ayn al- Qudat Hamadani have all been credited with deconstructing the rigid  logocentric assumptions within their own respective faiths, rescuing a more authentic spirituality from the legalistic metaphysics of their  times.7 Certainly one aim of this study is to show how a similar decon- structive process can be found in the writings of Ibn 2Arabi – a demon- stration, however, which is far from turning the Great Shaykh into a  medieval post-structuralist.

Hopefully, such comparisons will act as a point of departure for this study, and not as a destination in themselves. Rather than simply serving
