up a postmodern version of the Futuhat and the Fusus al-Hikam, a number of more serious questions will be raised: what is the exact  relationship between these two thinkers? How analogous can the vocab- ulary of a Sufi saint be to the work of a contemporary French theorist  who, on his own admission, ‘rightly pass(es) for an atheist’?8 Do the metaphors, strategies and motifs of deconstruction change their meaning at all in the context of a comparison with Sufism? Can Ibn 2Arabi teach us how to read Derrida differently (and vice versa)?

Derrida’s interest in Islam, it has to be said, has been slight.9 Apart from a handful of remarks in The Gift of Death and some remarks on  Algeria, comments on Islam and Islamic thought have been conspicu- ously absent in a writer who spent the early, formative years of his life  in a Muslim country (Algeria). What Derrida has been interested in,  however, is mysticism – or more precisely, the ways in which many com- mentators have either tried to re-describe Derrida as a mystic/negative  theologian, or have re-proposed figures from the mystical tradition such as Eckhart and Pseudo-Dionysius as predecessors for deconstruction.  Over the years, Derrida has spent a considerable amount of text object- ing to both these counts – amongst which the most significant work  appears to be his 1987 essay, ‘How to Avoid Speaking: Denials’. In  ‘Denials’, Derrida takes issue with the ‘Greek... and Christian para- digms’ of negative theology and tries to show how, even though ‘the  onto-theological re-appropriation [of différance] always remains possi- ble’,10 thinkers such as Pseudo-Dionysius and Eckhart are ultimately  concerned with something very different – the preservation of a ‘hyper- essentiality, a being beyond Being’.11 Nevertheless, in restricting his  choice to Greek and Christian versions of the apophatic, Derrida – who, far from being Greek or Christian, describes himself in Circumfession as a ‘very Arab little Jew’ – is aware of the various traditions he has not included in his face-to-face with negative theology:

> I thus decided not to speak of negativity or of apophatic movements in, for example, the Jewish or Islamic traditions. To leave this immense place empty, and above all that which can connect such a name of God with the name of the Place, to remain thus on the threshold – was this not the most consistent possible apophasis? Concerning that about which one cannot speak, isn’t it best to remain silent?12

It is an interesting admission – or o-mission – and one which inspires a number of questions: what exactly is the difference between the
